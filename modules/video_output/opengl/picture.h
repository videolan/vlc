/**
 * Return a matrix to orient texture coordinates
 *
 * This matrix is 2x2 and is stored in column-major order.
 *
 * While pic_to_tex_matrix transforms any picture coordinates into texture
 * coordinates, it may be useful for example for vertex or fragment shaders to
 * sample one pixel to the left of the current one, or two pixels to the top.
 * Since the input texture may be rotated or flipped, the shaders need to
 * know in which direction is the top and in which direction is the right of
 * the picture.
 *
 * This 2x2 matrix allows to transform a 2D vector expressed in picture
 * coordinates into a 2D vector expressed in texture coordinates.
 *
 * Concretely, it contains the coordinates (U, V) of the transformed unit
 * vectors u = / 1 \ and v = / 0 \:
 *             \ 0 /         \ 1 /
 *
 *     / Ux Vx \
 *     \ Uy Vy /
 *
 * It is guaranteed that:
 *  - both U and V are unit vectors (this matrix does not change the scaling);
 *  - only one of their components have a non-zero value (they may not be
 *    oblique); in other words, here are the possible values for U and V:
 *
 *        /  0 \  or  / 0 \  or  / 1 \  or  / -1 \
 *        \ -1 /      \ 1 /      \ 0 /      \  0 /
 *
 *  - U and V are orthogonal.
 *
 * Therefore, there are 8 possible matrices (4 possible rotations, flipped or
 * not).
 *
 * It may theoretically change on every picture (the transform matrix provided
 * by Android may change). If it has changed since the last picture, then
 * pic->mtx_has_changed is true.
