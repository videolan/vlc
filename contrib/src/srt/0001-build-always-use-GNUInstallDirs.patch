Subject: [PATCH] [build] always use GNUInstallDirs

It's possible to use GNUInstallDirs and allow the user to force some specific
target folder. The values set by the user are not overriden in that case [1]:

> If the includer does not define a value the above-shown default will be used
> and the value will appear in the cache for editing by the user.

With MSVC builds this doesn't change the default values used to install targets.
