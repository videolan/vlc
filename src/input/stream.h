/**
 * Probes stream filters automatically.
 *
 * This function automatically and repeatedly probes for applicable stream
 * filters to append downstream of an existing stream. Any such filter will
 * convert the stream into another stream, e.g. decompressing it or extracting
 * the list of contained files (playlist).
 *
 * This function transfers ownership of the supplied stream to the following
 * stream filter, of the first stream filter to the second stream filter, and
 * so on. Any attempt to access the original stream filter directly is
 * explicitly undefined.
 *
 * If, and only if, no filters were probed succesfully, a pointer to the
 * unchanged source stream will be returned. Otherwise, this returns a stream
 * filter. The return value is thus guaranteed to be non-NULL.
 *
 * @param source input stream around which to build a filter chain
 *
 * @return the last, most downstream stream object.
 *
 * @note The return value must be freed with vlc_stream_Delete() after use.
 * This will automatically free the whole chain and the underlying stream.

 * semantics; the only difference lies in how the list of probed filters is
 * determined (manually versus automatically).
 *
 * If the list is empty, or if probing each of the requested filters failed,
 * this function will return a pointer to the supplied source stream.
 *
 * @param source input stream around which to build a filter chain
 * @param list colon-separated list of stream filters (upstream first)
 *
 * @return The last stream (filter) in the chain.
 * The return value is always a valid (non-NULL) stream pointer.
