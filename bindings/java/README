            First of all, this is a *developers* only version


Usage
-----

 In order to use these bindings you have to compile vlc from source. I
recommend you to take the latest version from videolan svn repository
by doing:

svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/trunk vlc-trunk

 bootstrap and configure. At the configure give the command:

./configure --enable-mozilla && make && make install

 to enable compilation of _pic version of libraries. If you give a
prefix be sure to change the PREFIX variable in the Makefile from
 /usr/local to your prefix.

 Once you've done with vlc you can run make in jvlc directory. Be sure
you have gcj, gcjh and if you want to use the SUN Java compiler,
change the Makefile accordingly. You will probably need to change also 

JINCLUDES
LIBJINCLUDES

 In the next releases I will automate this process.

 To run JVLC issue:

java -Djava.library.path=. VlcClient

 Be sure your ldconfig can find libjawt.so and libmawt.so or you will
get linking errors when you run the program.

 Happy playing.
