/**
 * \defgroup playlist VLC playlist
 * \ingroup interface
 *
 * A VLC playlist contains a list of "playlist items".
 *
 * Each playlist item contains exactly one media (input item). In the future,
 * it might contain associated data.
 *
 * The API is intended to be simple, UI-friendly and allow for an
 * implementation both correct (no race conditions) and performant for common
 * use cases.
 *
 * UI frameworks typically use "list models" to provide a list of items to a
 * list view component. A list model requires to implement functions to:
 *  - return the total number of items,
 *  - return the item at a given index.
 *
 * In addition, it must notify the view when changes occur when:
 *  - items are inserted (providing index and count),
 *  - items are removed (providing index and count),
 *  - items are moved (providing index, count, and target index),
 *  - items are updated (providing index and count),
 *  - the model is reset (the whole content should be considered changed).
 *
 * The API directly exposes what list models require.
 *
 * The core playlist may be modified from any thread, so it may not be used as
 * a direct data source for a list model. In other words, the functions of a
 * list model must not delegate the calls to the playlist. This would require
 * locking the playlist individually for each call to get the count and
 * retrieve each item (which is, in itself, not a good idea for UI
 * responsiveness), and would not be sufficient to guarantee correctness: the
 * playlist content could change between view calls so that a request to
 * retrieve an item at a specific index could be invalid (which would break the
 * list model expected behavior).
 *
 * As a consequence, the UI playlist should be considered as a remote
 * out-of-sync view of the core playlist. This implies that the UI needs to
 * keep a copy of the playlist content.
 *
 * Note that the copy must not be limited to the list of playlist items
 * (pointers) themselves, but also to the item's content which is displayed and
 * susceptible to change asynchronously (e.g. media metadata, like title or
 * duration). The UI should never lock a media (input item) for rendering a
 * playlist item; otherwise, the content could be changed (and exposed) before
 * the list model notified the view of this change (which, again, would break
 * the list model expected behavior).
 *
 * It is very important that the copy held by the UI is only modified through
 * the core playlist callbacks, to guarantee that the indexes notified are
 * valid in the context of the list model. In other words, from the client, the
 * playlist copy is a read-only "desynchronized" view of the core playlist.
 *
 * Moreover, the events triggered by the playlist must be kept in order until
 * they are handled. The callbacks may be called from any thread, with lock
 * held (in practice, the thread from which a change is requested). A UI will
 * typically need to handle the events in the UI thread, so it will usually
 * post the events in an event loop, to handle them from the UI thread. In that
 * case, be careful to always post the events in the event loop, even if the
 * current thread is already the UI thread, not to break the order of events.
 *
 * The playlist also handles the playback order and the repeat mode. It also
 * manages a cursor to the "current" item, and exposes whether previous and
 * next items (which depend on the playback order and repeat mode) are
 * available.
 *
 * When a user requests to insert, move or remove items, or to set the current
 * item, before the core playlist lock is successfully acquired, another client
 * may have changed the list. Therefore, vlc_playlist_Request*() functions are
 * exposed to resolve potential conflicts and apply the changes. The actual
 * changes applied are notified through the callbacks.
