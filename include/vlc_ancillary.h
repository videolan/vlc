/**
 * \defgroup ancillary Ancillary
 * \ingroup input
 *
 * Ancillary that can be attached to any vlc_frame_t or picture_t.
 *
 * Ancillaries can be created from:
 *  - packetized demuxer modules,
 *  - packetizer modules,
 *  - decoder modules.
 *
 *  @warning Ancillaries should not be attached from a non packetized demuxer
 *  module since the attachment to the vlc_frame will be lost by the packetizer
 *  module that will be automatically inserted.
 *
 * Ancillaries are automatically forwarded from a vlc_frame_t to an other
 * vlc_frame_t and from a picture_t to an other picture_t. This allow to keep
 * ancillaries untouched when audio filters or video filters are used (these
 * filters don't have to know about the ancillary).
 *
 * Ancillary readers can be either:
 *  - A decoder module,
 *  - An audio output,
 *  - A video output,
 *  - A video or audio filter.
