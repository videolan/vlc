 Less verbosity.

2002-12-31 Tuesday 01:54  massiot

 thread priorities for WinNT/2k/XP or Win9x/Me.

2002-12-30 Monday 17:28  gbazin

 * modules/codec/*: make sure all audio decoders set
 output_format.i_bytes_per_frame and output_format.i_frame_length
 properly.

2002-12-30 Monday 13:34  sam

2002-12-29 Sunday 21:00  babal

 no time to fix the playlist save&restore issue before the release (and
 wouldn't be wise anyway), so deactivated it in the win32 interface.

     and used AC_EGREP_CPP instead.

2002-12-28 Saturday 01:20  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: we don't link with -lintl if building against our
     internal one.

2002-12-27 Friday 15:40  sam

   * ./modules/demux/avi/avi.c: replaced a useless asprintf with sprintf.

2002-12-27 Friday 15:31  sam

   * ./src/extras/libc.c: if configure is called with --with-included-gettext,
     we export vlc_dgettext to plugins so that their messages can be translated
     as well.

2002-12-27 Friday 14:16  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: added a check for $EGREP at the beginning, so that
     it's not done in an obscure "if" statement.
   * ./configure.ac.in: added verbosity around all EGREP calls so that we
     know what's going on.

2002-12-27 Friday 12:44  sam

   * ./Makefile.am: we don't try to distribute mozilla/vlcintf.h since it's
     created at compile time.

2002-12-27 Friday 09:57  massiot

 Audio output.

2002-12-27 Friday 09:47  massiot

   * ./configure.ac.in: lured xggettext into thinking _NS is a keyword.
   * ./bootstrap: bootstrap --update-po also updates vlc.pot.

2002-12-25 Wednesday 21:02  massiot

2002-12-24 Tuesday 09:49  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: fixed dpms.h detection (missing prerequisite headers).

2002-12-23 Monday 22:00  jpsaman

 Enabled --with-gpe-prefix in buildscript.

2002-12-23 Monday 21:58  jpsaman

 Set priority of sdl video output to 60 iso 40. So it is now the default choice for iPaq iso x11.

2002-12-23 Monday 17:22  bozo

 Little fixes.

2002-12-23 Monday 16:21  massiot

2002-12-22 Sunday 17:08  sam

   * ./src/audio_output/input.c: fixed a side-effect problem in buffer dates
     recalculation (spotted by KKI).

2002-12-21 Saturday 11:20  sigmunau

  first shot at a file info dialog for the wxwindows interface. It still
 needs to get a sane default size and some cleanups of the code, but I commit
 now in case anyone wants it during cristmas

2002-12-20 Friday 21:33  jpsaman

 Defenitely fixed segmentation fault on directory change.

 - better workaround for broken mdk configure macro (aka don't harcore arch in name).

2002-12-19 Thursday 23:23  sigmunau

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: provide some file info. Tested with the tarzan.ogm
 * modules/codec/vorbis.c: parse the vorbis comment (can anyone tell me why the
 comment is embedded in the logical stream and not directly in the
 container?). The vorbis comments are in utf8, so extended characters
 currently get messed up.

 Still tring to close #51

2002-12-19 Thursday 17:29  massiot

 Fixed an HTTP compliance issue (thanks Xag).

2002-12-19 Thursday 16:59  sigmunau

 the avi demux now gives some info about the file being played. One step
 towards closing bug #51. Type 'info' in the rc interface to test.

2002-12-18 Wednesday 17:52  gbazin

 * src/libvlc.h, src/input/input_dec.c: added an "sout-video" and
 "sout-audio" config option that allows to selectively enable audio or
 video stream output. This is very useful if you want to play video on
 one computer and audio on another one ;)

2002-12-18 Wednesday 16:33  fenrir

  * mpeg4video: repeat vol headers every 30 frames (But it is buggy)

2002-12-18 Wednesday 16:31  fenrir

  * video.c: with mpeg4 stream, we try to decode a picture only when we have
 received an header (vol). (It prevents some segfaults with mpeg4 streaming).

2002-12-18 Wednesday 16:27  fenrir

  * ts.c: add preliminary support for mpeg-4 streams in mpeg2-TS.
 Becareful that up to now, it's more a hack. (I need to add SL streams
 managments)

2002-12-18 Wednesday 16:16  sam

   * ./modules/demux/avi/libavi.c: added an additional sanity check for
     corrupted headers.

   * ./modules/codec/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: cosmetic change, the ffmpeg module now
     tells what libavcodec build it was built with.

2002-12-18 Wednesday 14:17  sam

   * fixed several format string inconsistencies and deprecated C constructions.

2002-12-18 Wednesday 12:18  sam

   * ./src/misc/messages.c: woops, __attribute__(format) is only needed in the
     prototype.

2002-12-18 Wednesday 11:47  sam

   * ./include/vlc_messages.h: msg_* functions now use the same argument type
     checks as printf. Only works with gcc 3.2 it seems.

2002-12-18 Wednesday 09:27  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/qte/.cvsignore: added a missing .cvsignore.
   * ./modules/video_chroma/Modules.am: added i420_rgb_c.h to the distribution,
     thanks to Stepan Roh for spotting this.

2002-12-18 Wednesday 08:08  gbazin

 * src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a bug concerning the aspect
 ratio in vout_Request().

 * INSTALL.win32: small update to the documentation.

 * mpegaudio: fixed another stupid bug for mpeg audio layer 3 only.

2002-12-17 Tuesday 21:58  fenrir

  * ts.c: removed an unused variable.

2002-12-17 Tuesday 21:15  gbazin

 * modules/demux/rawdv.c: new raw dv demuxer (only video for now). I
 didn't find a way to detect correctly a raw dv file so for now we just
 check the file extension (.dv). You can additionaly force this demuxer.

 PS: the ffmpeg plugin works quite well for decoding dv videos.

2002-12-17 Tuesday 21:04  jpsaman

 Functionality of Familiar Linux Gtk+ interface is finished. Only testing on iPaqwith libgpewidget0  still needs to be done.

 Workaround for crash in ReadDirectory when called from the comboURL text box. For now it is mandatory to prefix filepaths on local disk with "file://" when typing it in the comboURL box.

2002-12-16 Monday 20:18  titer

  Fixed a possible crash.

2002-12-16 Monday 18:30  gbazin

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: added support for the old type of headers produced by the first
 versions of OggDS.

2002-12-16 Monday 16:48  gbazin

 * modules/access/udp.c, modules/access/rtp.c, modules/misc/network/ipv4.c: only check for
 the "server-port" config variable in the access plugins. access_output plugins will now
 pick a port at random, thus allowing sout to work out of the box on a localhost. (thanks
 Meuuh)

2002-12-16 Monday 15:17  fenrir

  * compilation fix for Os X.

2002-12-16 Monday 13:04  fenrir

2002-12-16 Monday 00:41  babal

 - disc.* : a few enhancements in the design of the "open disc" dialog
   box, including the ability to select dvd menus instead of a particular

2002-12-15 Sunday 23:39  fenrir

  * modules/mux/mpeg/*: should fix builtin compilation
  * modules/access/ftp.c : an ftp access, buggy but it begins to work.
 The main issue is about password confidentiality so you must know

2002-12-15 Sunday 22:55  yves

 you can now build RPMs.
 (ffmpeg still not working properly cause configure.ac seems to sucks)

2002-12-15 Sunday 22:54  jpsaman

 Packaging files for Familiar GPE and OPIE releases.

2002-12-15 Sunday 22:48  jpsaman

 Familiar interface build with GPE support does not use NEED_GTK_MAIN.

 Make distinction between GPE and GTK_NEED_MAIN way of handling interface.
 Trying to fix change directory crash while entering keys in combobox.

  * ./modules/gui/wxwindows: added a log window

2002-12-15 Sunday 16:28  gbazin

 * include/vlc/vlc.h: added a new pi_types field to vlc_list_t. This field will be used
 later on by the object variables functions. I'm adding it now because it also happens to
 solve a binary compatibility problem between gcc and bcc. (depending on compilers,
 structs of 32 < size <= 64 bits can be returned either in a register or in the stack).

2002-12-14 Saturday 23:17  jpsaman

 Fix for building Familiar interface with libgpewidget0 library.

 * src/libvlc.c: oops, forgot to remove a debug message.

2002-12-14 Saturday 19:34  gbazin

 * src/misc/objects.c: implemented the FIND_CHILD mode for vlc_list_find().
    vlc_object_get() now increments the refcount of the object so you'll need to release
 the object at some point.
 * src/misc/variables.c, ALL: var_Change() with VLC_VAR_GETLIST now returns a vlc_value_t
 which points to a vlc_list_t.

2002-12-14 Saturday 19:19  gbazin

 * src/misc/threads.c: implemented vlc_thread_set_priority() for win32.

2002-12-14 Saturday 18:57  fenrir

2002-12-13 Friday 16:26  babal

 - vlc_playlist.h, playlist.c: added the ability to save a playlist to
   and restore it from a file chosen by the user.

 - win32/*:

   - implementation of the previous feature in the win32 interface
 >   -> what the other interfaces need to do to support it is simply to

 >       int playlist_SaveFile(playlist_t *p_playlist,const char *psz_filename);
 >      where psz_filename is the name of the destination/source file.

   - ability to open several files at a time

2002-12-13 Friday 10:09  sam

   * ./Makefile.am: added missing files for make dist.
   * ./configure.ac.in: removed unpopular warnings.
   * ./po/*: updated potfiles.

2002-12-13 Friday 03:52  videolan

  * ./modules/win32/menu.cpp: reorganized the code for menus generation,
    and got rid of the global variable (at last!) in the win32 interface.

 Please check that navigation and language selection aren't too much
 broken for DVDs...

2002-12-13 Friday 01:56  gbazin

 * include/configuration.h: rolled back the last changes made to this file. There is no
 sense in manually initializing all the fields of module_config_t as it will be done by the

 - new headphone channel mixer with virtual spatialization effect : This
   effect should give you the feeling that you stands in a real room with
   a complete 5.1 speaker set when using only a headphone, providing a
   more realistic sound experience. It should also be more comfortable
   and less tiring when listening to music for long periods of time.It
   works with any source format from mono to 5.1.

   -> please try it and feel free to give me some feedback. Some
      improvements are already planned (adding echo, more configuration
      options, ...).

 NB: whereas the filter itself is in a (very first) stable version, the
     way it is integrated to the filter chain is only a _temporary_ hack
     since it's the audio ouput core (input.c actually) which is directly
     responsible for it. Integrating it in a more suitable way will
     probably require some work on the way the filters are selected as
     well as on the configuration level, but I'm working on it :)

2002-12-08 Sunday 05:30  jlj

   * ALL: Under Jaguar, vout no longer depends on any specific MacOS X
          intf. wxWindows should work (not tested). Closes #33.

 New vlc_thread_set_priority function, to set the priority of the main
 thread.

   warnings than real ones.
 * audio output: New intf-change variable to know when audio-channels
   and audio-device have changed.
 * video output: New intf-change variable and vout_VarCallback, to know
   when video-device has changed (OS X port).

  * use RGB32 BBitmap. That fixes the bad-looking picture in
    non-overlay mode (thanks Sam).

2002-12-07 Saturday 15:25  gbazin

 * ALL: a few updates to the variables API:
   - got rid of the VLC_VAR_COMMAND variable type and introduced the VLC_VAR_ISCOMMAND flag
 instead. This simplifies things and avoid the strange command variables behaviour. Command
 variables will now trigger their callback on var_Set() like any other variables (look in
 modules/control/rc/rc.c for an example).
   - Renamed the VLC_VAR_ISLIST flag into VLC_VAR_HASCHOICE.
   - Added a new VLC_VAR_VOID variable type. This can be useful in conjunction with
 VLC_VAR_ISCOMMAND for instance.

2002-12-06 Friday 22:44  gitan

 * sap.c : make it more compliant (as far as sdp is involved).
 * playlist.c : fixed a memory leak
 * configure.ac.in : added link flags

2002-12-06 Friday 21:27  gbazin

     it was doing, though :)

2002-12-06 Friday 12:54  sam

   * ./modules/access/http.c: code clean-up. removed sizeof()-1 calls where we
     meant strlen(), removed useless strcmp() calls, implemented atoll() for
     systems where it does not exist, fixed a memory leak, fixed a minor data
     corruption.

2002-12-06 Friday 12:18  sigmunau

 some support for redirection. Moved the break on returncode >=400 to after
 the header parsing. This will be usefull if anyone wants to implemet
 http-passwd support

2002-12-06 Friday 11:53  fenrir

  * ffmpeg: sync with latest ffmpeg cvs. As it need too much
 #if LIBAVCODEC_BUILD , I've enable direct rendering only with latest
 ffmpeg cvs (anyway dr isn't cleanly ported to the latest version).

2002-12-06 Friday 10:10  sam

   * ./src/*, ./include/*: fixed a bunch of badly initialized structures, a few
     signed/unsigned comparisons, and removed trailing spaces here and there.

2002-12-06 Friday 06:42  babal

  * src/playlist/playlist.c : playing again a playlist already in a
    playing state resets the input speed to normal to make sure the
    stream isn't paused or slowed or played faster anymore.
    By doing that, fixes the following bug of the Windows interface:
    when pushing the play button on a paused or slowed stream, nothing
    used to happen.
  * modules/gui/win32/playlist.cpp : when pushing the play button and the
    playlist is empty, displaying the playlist window
  * win32.cpp : rephrasing the module description to "Native Windows
    interface module"

   * ./configure.ac.in: disabled -Wconversion for gcc 2.x because it makes it
     choke on system headers.

2002-12-05 Thursday 17:16  sam

   * ./ipkg/Makefile.in: removed a file handled by automake.
   * ./configure.ac.in: additional warning flags for GCC.
        -Wconversion
            Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from
            what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a proto-
            type.
        -Wsign-compare
            Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could
            produce an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to
            unsigned.
        -Wunreachable-code
            Warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed.
        -Wdisabled-optimization
            Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.
     See the gcc documentation for more explanations. This triggers a lot of
     warnings everywhere, and at first sight they're all worth fixing. Code
     quality matters, too, so let's fix'em :)

  * adpcm.c: add adpcm decoding support (Now just ms and ima adpcm from
 microfsoft, not yet ima4)
  * wav, asf, avi: fix fourcc creation for adpcm. (Nevertheless adpcm
 could not work with asf because of asf audio scrambling unsupported in asf
 demuxer). Seek will not work, because vlc send garbage and then break stream
 alignment.(I will try to fix that).

2002-12-03 Tuesday 16:29  gitan

 * Added a session announcement protol module (enabled by default).
 * Added the PLAYLIST_CHECK_INSERT option to the playlist. That option
 checks previously enqueued sessions before enqueing.

 * set b_seakable to false for http/1.0 streams such as those from icecast.
 * allow some unusual, but legal ways to construct the http headers, and
 clean up the header parsing code. parsing other headers ( like the mime-type
 ) should be very easy now.

2002-11-28 Thursday 14:34  sam

   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: added a --aspect-ratio option to force
     the aspect ratio of the stream. Two different usages are possible, either
     int:int ("16:9") to specify a real aspect ratio, or float ("1.25") to
     specify pixel squareness.

     Note that it does not work properly yet; it will need an API change in
     the video output layer that I'm working on.

 - Enterely new layout for the preference window of the native win32
   interface, in order to improve its clarity (the dialog box is now even
   a bit smaller) and to get closer to Windows standards.

   Ipkiss a few days ago by using CheckListBoxes)

   Still need some work to get the interface compatible with Windows XP

   * ./configure.ac.in: activated the wingdi plugin by default.

     prevent gcc's optimizer to go amok with nested inline functions, loop
     unrolling and such things that we don't really need in an access plugin.

2002-11-22 Friday 15:24  sam

     we are sure that the WndProc always has a valid p_vout value.

2002-11-22 Friday 15:19  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/wingdi.c: implemented offscreen rendering with
     fast blit (well at least it was considered "fast" back in the times of
     Windows 3.1). Default is 8bpp because that's what my iPaq does (no
     palette support yet though), 16bpp can be chosen at compile time and
     works perfectly in the emulator.

2002-11-21 Thursday 09:39  gbazin

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: better handling of PCRs (we now base our calculations
    on all sub-streams instead of just using one of them). Some code factorisation
    too.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 21:51  jpsaman

 Build and link Familiar interface against libgpewidget for gpe support.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 21:27  jpsaman

 Fix detection of AR and LD

2002-11-20 Wednesday 21:23  jpsaman

 Updated for release v_0.4.6 of Familiar Linux packages.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 19:07  sam

   * ./src/misc/messages.c: added ^Ms to the WinCE logfile.
   * ./bootstrap: fixed a typo that prevented per-object target directories
     to work.
   * ./evc/*, ./msvc/*: removed project files; they're becoming a bit large
     (more than 1MB) and I don't want to spoil the CVS with them.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 17:23  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: temporary hack for libdvbpsi detection.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 16:43  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/waveout.c: audio output now works under WinCE
     using the waveout module.
   * ./bootstrap: we ignore comments when parsing makefiles.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/fixed32tofloat32.c: changed this module
     so that it also does float32tofixed32.
   * ./modules/*: ported a few other modules to WinCE (most of the time it's
     just a #include <errno.h> that needs to be removed).

2002-11-20 Wednesday 15:58  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/gui/wxwindows/wxwindows.cpp: other compilation
    fixes for the wxwindows interface on win32.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 15:34  gbazin

 * modules/control/rc/rc.c: added commands to navigate between chapters and
    titles.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 14:24  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: fixes for the win32 build. Removed a few
    unnecessary things and replaced the stop icon with a new one.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 14:09  gbazin

 * modules/codec/theora.c, configure.ac.in, modules/codec/Modules.am: new
    theora codec plugin.
    This plugin is based on the experimental theora codec from the Xiph.Org
    foundation (http://www.theora.org/). Because the theora bitstream
    specifications are likely to change in the near future, this plugin won't
    be compiled by default. If you want to test/develop theora with vlc, you'll
    need to configure it with --enable-theora and also make sure you've got a
    fresh libogg from cvs.

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: modified to handle theora and tarkin bitstreams.

 * modules/codec/tarkin.c: fixed a few typos.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 13:37  sam

   * ./evc/plugins.vcp.in: fixed plugin entry points for WinCE.
   * ./modules/*: fixed a bunch of modules so that they compile under WinCE,
     we now have access_file and the mpeg demux and video decoder working
     (http://zoy.org/~sam/vlc/pocketvlc2.png).

2002-11-20 Wednesday 08:58  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h, ./src/extras/libc.c: exported our custom libc
     functions to plugins.
   * ./bootstrap: enhanced the project file generation for plugins; we now
     parse makefiles to make this easier.
   * ./modules/**/Modules.am: reworked a few makefiles so that they are more
     easily parsed.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 01:47  gbazin

 * src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a really old bug in the video output
    layer. This bug was only affecting video outputs without direct rendering
    capabilities.

2002-11-19 Tuesday 20:56  gbazin

 * modules/misc/network/ipv6.c: restored the msg_*() outputs from BuildAddr().

2002-11-19 Tuesday 20:45  gbazin

 * include/video.h, include/vlc_config.h, src/video_output/*: changed the
    picture buffer allocation scheme to allocate pictures from the render
    heap in a clockwise fashion instead of always picking the first available
    one from the start of the heap.
    This allows us to benefit from ffmpeg's macro-block skipping feature.
    As a side effect, we also have less chance of reusing a refrence picture
    buffer when we can't link/unlink them.

 * modules/codec/ffmpeg/video.c: modified the direct rendering code to benefit
    from the macro-block skipping algorithm.
    A new flag has also been introduced in the video_output's render heap to
    forbid modifications to the render picture buffers (for instance to overlay
    subtitles).

2002-11-19 Tuesday 17:38  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: p_module->psz_filename is now filled with a real
     8 bit string under WinCE.
   * ./extras/Win32_msvc: scrapped this directory.
   * ./bootstrap: we now parse plugin makefiles to guess what to put in
     the MSVC project files. Only the dummy plugin has been tested yet.

2002-11-19 Tuesday 17:23  fenrir

  all: Use BITMAPINFOHEADER everywhere (Needed because of endian issue).

2002-11-18 Monday 23:00  massiot

 Partial fix of the OS X audio output (thanks Heiko!).

2002-11-18 Monday 19:31  fenrir

  * ogg: change i_dts usage for subtitle ES.

2002-11-18 Monday 18:37  gbazin

 * src/misc/modules.c: fixed small typo that was breaking the build.

2002-11-18 Monday 18:05  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: support for Unicode filenames under WinCE; VLC now
     successfully opens plugins.
   * ./modules/misc/dummy/*: hacked the dummy plugin so that it compiles for
     WinCE.

2002-11-18 Monday 17:31  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: updated the toolbar icons.

2002-11-18 Monday 16:39  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/interface.cpp: enabled the OpenFile dialog box.

2002-11-18 Monday 15:19  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/interface.cpp: fixed typo.
 * modules/audio_filter/converter/u8tofloat32.c: fixed typo.

2002-11-18 Monday 13:28  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/codec/Modules.am, modules/codec/tarkin.c: added
    an experimental tarkin video decoder. You will need to specify the tarkin
    tree you want to use with --with-tarkin-tree=.

    Warning: Tarkin is still in very early development stage, so this plugin isn't
    actually usefull unless you intend to do some development on tarkin itself.

2002-11-18 Monday 13:08  gbazin

 * modules/demux/m3u.c: should manage entries with relative paths.
 * src/playlist/playlist.c: fixed playlist_Next().

2002-11-18 Monday 13:02  gbazin

 * added a wxwindows interface using the wxWindows cross-platform GUI framework.
    The interface is quite basic for now but should be functional anyway.
    (you need to have wxWindows >= 2.3.0 installed to use this plugin)

2002-11-18 Monday 11:50  sam

   * ./bootstrap: reverted the behaviour behaviour to the default, which
     means no default flag to use (except for me, muahaha).

2002-11-18 Monday 02:46  fenrir

  * ffmpeg: set bug detection to auto by default.

2002-11-17 Sunday 06:46  fenrir

  * ffmpeg: disable direct rendering by default. I have too many files
 that don't work with it (I don't see why it doesn't work :(
  * mp4: fix a bug in timestamp calculation. Replace s/u* by s/uint*_t
  * avi : remove an useless debug message.
  * src/misc/objects.c : fix stream output object allocation.

2002-11-16 Saturday 22:25  fenrir

  * avi: fix playing over http (a bug I have introduced).

2002-11-15 Friday 18:10  fenrir

 * modules/demux/util : add a text subtitle demuxer. (Module called by demux).
 MicroDVD, SubRIP, SSA subtitle format should work...
  Options: --sub-file <subtitle file> [--sub-fps, --sub-delay --sub-format].

  * modules/demux/avi : make use of subtitle parser.
  * modules/demux/asf : display movie length. (It will not work with live
 streams of course).

  modules/codec/spudec : use i_dts to send end of display time for subtitle.
 (Yes it's ugly, but it works :)

2002-11-15 Friday 17:17  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/audio_output/arts.c, modules/audio_output/esd.c:
    fixed the arts and esd audio plugins after the recent changes to aout3
    (untested).

2002-11-15 Friday 16:27  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/audio_output/directx.c, modules/audio_output/waveout.c:
    fixed the waveout and directx audio plugins after the recent changes to aout3.

2002-11-15 Friday 14:41  gbazin

 * modules/access/http.c: added an http-proxy config variable. If the variable
    is not set, we'll still look at the value of the http_proxy environment
    variable.

2002-11-15 Friday 12:22  sam

   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: backport of a fix in MAIN for
     spoiled FPU registers.

2002-11-15 Friday 01:23  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: fixed a few typos regarding LDFLAGS_access_*. Re-enabled
    the oss plugin as it seems to be working fine.
 * src/audio_output/input.c: fixed an obscure bug... (strange one though:
    int foo = -1; unsigned int bar = 2; __MAX( foo, bar) == -1 ).

2002-11-15 Friday 01:17  fenrir

  faad: adapt to new changes in aout3 (at least it compiles)

2002-11-15 Friday 00:41  gbazin

 * modules/codec/vorbis.c, modules/audio_filter/resampler/linear.c: adapted to
    the new changes in aout3.

2002-11-14 Thursday 22:44  alexis

 Added the changelog of vlc 0.4.6.

2002-11-14 Thursday 22:38  massiot

 Major change of the channels management. p_format->i_channels disappeares
 and is replaced by two members : i_physical_channels and i_original_channels.
 i_physical_channels describes the channels which are effectively present
 in the stream (at the current point of the aout pipeline), whereas
 i_original_channels represents the channels we used to constitute the
 stream. For instance a mono stream (FRONT_CENTER) may emanate from a
 FRONT_LEFT channel of a STEREO stream.

 Additionally, this contains hooks to dynamically select the audio device
 and the channels configuration. In order to do that, all aout plugins,
 and all interface plug-ins need to be adapted. Currently only SDL
 (partially OSS) and the rc interface have been adapted, please use them
 as a guide. Other aout plug-ins have been temporarily disabled.

 IMPORTANT : if you need a working sound output, DO NOT UPDATE YOUR TREE
 for several days until we fix that.

 * modules/misc/network/ipv4.c: Fixed a long-standing segfault when saving
   preferences and asking for multicast.

2002-11-14 Thursday 16:32  fenrir

  mms.c: it takes care of --no-audio and --no-video (to reduce bandwith
 usage),  and should not use more than --mms-maxbitrate (when there
 are multiple audio or video streams).

2002-11-14 Thursday 16:17  fenrir

  asf/* : Convert all u* into uint*_t
          Fix playing of some live asf, seek improvement (at least for me ;)
 but it's more some "kludge" with vlc clock than true fixes ...

  I will never understand how vlc clock works ....

2002-11-14 Thursday 15:07  sigmunau

  make --version --help --longhelp --list and -p output to stdout.

2002-11-14 Thursday 14:08  gbazin

 * src/audio_output/intf.c: fixed a bug affecting audio volume initialization.

2002-11-13 Wednesday 22:36  massiot

 * OS X plug-in fix ;
 * Re-enabled float32 mixer (huh?).

2002-11-13 Wednesday 22:36  gbazin

 * Updated changelog and package files.

2002-11-13 Wednesday 21:58  gbazin

 * ChangeLog: updated ChangeLog.

2002-11-13 Wednesday 21:18  fenrir

  * fix and make better stream selection (if mms-maxbitrate unset, get the best
 quality else try to be closed to mms-maxbitrate ).

2002-11-13 Wednesday 20:51  sam

   * ./bootstrap: bootstrap now requires the --config flag. With no arguments
     it simply outputs a usage message.
   * ./src/*: fixed a bunch of (legitimate) warnings under VC++.
   * ./evc/*, ./msvc/*: split the workspaces into three projects (libvlc, vlc
     and plugins -- plugins doesn't build anything yet).

2002-11-13 Wednesday 20:28  fenrir

  * mms/* : better stream selection and add some options to override it.
 (Usefull with demuxdump).

2002-11-13 Wednesday 20:23  fenrir

  access/* : don't override demux setting made by user.
  modules/demux/demuxdump.c : a little demux that dump raw stream.
 (should work with all access...)

2002-11-13 Wednesday 15:28  sam

   * ./msvc/*, ./evc/*: moved eMbedded Visual Studio files to the toplevel evc/
     directory because the two project files are starting to diverge.
   * ./evc/vlc.c: created a specific vlc.c file for Windows CE.
   * ./src/misc/messages.c: as WinCE doesn't have stdout or stderr, the message
     queue outputs to a logfile (until we have a proper interface).

2002-11-13 Wednesday 12:58  gbazin

 * src/playlist/playlist.c: bugfix for when we delete the last playlist
    element (I'll get this one right... eventually ;).
 * modules/demux/m3u.c: allow forcing the demux to be used by specifying the
    asx or m3u demux.

2002-11-13 Wednesday 11:09  gbazin

 * src/playlist/playlist.c: when autodeleting an item, we don't need to skip
    to the next one.
 * modules/demux/m3u.c: added .asx support and changed the autodetection of
    file type to just probe the file extension.

2002-11-13 Wednesday 09:56  sam

   * ./po/POTFILES.in: fixed "make dist".

2002-11-13 Wednesday 09:45  sam

   * ./FAQ: changed Debian repository location to HTTP (for better upload
     stats estimations on our side).

2002-11-12 Tuesday 22:18  sigmunau

  added a new demux that reads .m3u files and addes the contained items to
 the playlist. Currently only autodetects files that start with #EXTM3U
 otherwise you'll have to force it.

2002-11-12 Tuesday 21:20  gbazin

 * include/vlc_playlist.h, src/playlist/playlist.c: added a b_autodeletion
    flag to the playlist item structure. If this flag is set then the playlist
    item will be deleted automatically after it has been played.

2002-11-12 Tuesday 16:02  gbazin

 * modules/gui/gtk/gtk_callbacks.c: fixed deadlocks.
 * modules/gui/gtk/gtk.c: fixed uninitialized variables.

2002-11-12 Tuesday 13:57  sam

   * ./Makefile.am: fixed rc compilation under mingw32/cygwin.
   * ./modules/access/http.c: fixed a segfault (unchecked strstr return value).
   * ./src/input/input_ext-plugins.c: removed platform-specific code and put
     it in plugins. This leads to some code duplication but I have an evil
     plan to get rid of that, too.

2002-11-12 Tuesday 11:45  gbazin

 * modules/gui/gtk/gtk.c: small bug-fix for a crash on module loading.

2002-11-12 Tuesday 10:44  gbazin

 * src/extras/libc.c: fixed typo.
 * configure.ac.in: compilation fix on win32 for the mms access plugin (the
    plugin is linked with ws2_32).

2002-11-12 Tuesday 00:54  fenrir

  * modules/demux/asf/.cvsignore : put the good one.
  * modules/access/mms : add MMS (Microsoft Media Streaming) access (Support
 only TCP, I will try to add UDP and HTTP as well).
  There are some problems with streams selections and we cannot seek, but
 anyway it seems to work. (Usefull for some radio web)
  * other: enable mms access by default.

2002-11-11 Monday 22:27  gbazin

 * src/audio_output/filters.c, src/audio_output/input.c, include/aout_internal.h,
    modules/audio_filter/resampler/*: Changes that allow the resamplers to set
    the start and end date of the frame it outputs.
    This allows us for instance to output a smaller frame than what we should, and
    keep the rest of the data to compute the resampling of the next frame.
    In short, we can implement much more complex resampling algorithms than before.

 * modules/audio_filter/resampler/linear.c: rewrote the linear resampler. The audio
    quality doesn't seem to be better than the ugly resampler, maybe I shouldn't
    have wasted my time on this...

2002-11-11 Monday 19:16  gbazin

 * modules/audio_output/file.c: will write a WAV header by default. Can be
    disabled with --no-audiofile-wav.
 * modules/audio_filter/resampler/linear.c: disabled for now, until I actually
    manage to make it work without a problem.

2002-11-11 Monday 14:39  sam

   * ./include/*, ./src/*: separated WIN32 #tests and UNDER_CE #tests, because
     WIN32 isn't always defined under WinCE, but might be. Grmbl.
   * ./include/*: changed a few u* and s* to uint*_t and int*_t.

2002-11-10 Sunday 23:41  sam

   * ALL: libvlc now compiles and run under WinCE. I haven't ported any modules
     yet so there's little that can be tested, but threads work at least.
   * ./src/extras/libc.c: renamed strndup.c to libc.c because a few other
     libc functions were added (strcasecmp, atof, getenv...).

2002-11-10 Sunday 18:04  sam

   * ALL: WinCE compilation fixes (mostly nonexistent headers). A lot of
     work is still needed for missing functions. I only touched libvlc for
     the moment, plugins will come in a long long while.
   * ./bootstrap: moved MSVC project files generation here; use --update-msvc.

2002-11-10 Sunday 16:31  fenrir

  all: fix a bug in packet parsing and can now play unseekable stream.

2002-11-10 Sunday 15:37  fenrir

  http: Accept ICY server reponse (Used for some web radio) and in that
 case it forces mp3 demuxer (Should be ok...)

2002-11-10 Sunday 14:31  gbazin

 * src/audio_output/output.c: fixed another quality affecting bug.

 * include/aout_internal.h src/audio_output/input.c: major change to the
    resampling algorithm. When resampling is requested to keep the audio stream
    synchronised to the main clock, we trigger it but we change the resampling
    rate only progressively so it doesn't get noticed too much by the listener.

2002-11-10 Sunday 13:24  sigmunau

  ./ChangeLog: added entry for the linear resampler
  ./modules/audio_filter/resampler/linear.c: This should allways generate the
 right number of samples now. The morale is never base your floating point
 calculations on the output of integer divitions.

2002-11-10 Sunday 02:47  fenrir

  * faad : adapt to newer version.
  * ffmpeg : adapt postprocessing for latest libavcodec version, add an
 option to disable direct rendering as postprocessing is currently broken
 with it, and with some files I have bad pictures.

2002-11-09 Saturday 18:28  sam

   * ./msvc/vlc.dsp: additional fixes to the MSVC project.
   * ./msvc/vlc.vcw: skeleton of a WinCE project file (yet non-functional).

2002-11-09 Saturday 18:28  sam

  * ./include/aout_internal.h: fixed a breakage I just introduced.

2002-11-09 Saturday 17:44  sam

   * A few additional MSVC build fixes.

2002-11-09 Saturday 16:39  sam

   * ./msvc/*: MSVC project files and default config files.

2002-11-09 Saturday 16:34  sam

   * ./Makefile.am: added a "update-vlc.dsp" rule to create the MSVC project
     file from the makefile.
   * ./msvc/*: moved the MSVC files here.
   * ./src/extras/*: moved the extra code here (used to be in src/misc,
     extras/GNUgetopt and extras/Win32_msvc).
   * ./include/*: a few warning fixes.

2002-11-08 Friday 14:23  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/audio_filter/converter/*: added a s8tofloat32.c and
    u8tofloat32.c converter.
 * modules/codec/araw.c: modified to also decode u8 pcm audio samples.

2002-11-08 Friday 10:26  gbazin

 * ALL: using "%ll" in printf format strings is not portable (notably on win32) so
    we now use the I64Fx familly of macros to print 64 bits numbers (x being
    replaced by d,i,o,u,x or X).
    eg: msg_Dbg( p_this, "sample is "I64Fi" late", ll_time );

 * src/misc/messages.c: got rid of ConvertPrintfFormatString().

2002-11-07 Thursday 22:56  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h: compilation fix for Cygwin.

2002-11-07 Thursday 21:09  sigmunau

  added a new resampler based on linear interpolation, giving a fair tradeoff
 between sound quality and speed

2002-11-07 Thursday 19:31  gbazin

 * INSTALL.win32, include/vlc_config.h, src/libvlc.h: changes to reflect the
    fact that libdvdcss now needs a colon after the DVD drive letter (on Win32).

 * src/misc/messages.c: on Win32 only use fflush() if in debug mode.

 * src/misc/win32_specific.c: try to raise the our process priority slightly
    above normal. This prevent us from suffering too much from normal activity
    of the OS.

2002-11-07 Thursday 16:54  gbazin

 * modules/access/http.c: don't crash, but complain on non http/1.x streams.

2002-11-06 Wednesday 21:48  gbazin

 * modules/codec/spudec/*: modified the spu decoder to handle text subtitles.
    Only one format of text subtitles is supported right now but we should be able
    to expand this by modifying modules/codec/spudec/text.c.
    Most of this work comes from by Andrew Flintham ( thanks a bunch Andrew :).

 * share/font-eutopiabold36.rle: new font for the text subtitler, courtesy of
    Andrew Flintham.

 * AUTHORS: added Andrew Flintham to the authors file.

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: modified the ogg demuxer to handle subtitles.

 * modules/codec/ffmpeg/*: modified the ffmpeg decoder to always keep the last decoded
    frame linked.

2002-11-06 Wednesday 18:07  sam

   * ./modules/access/dvdplay/access.c: activated button highlighting.
   * ./modules/codec/spudec/parse.c: implemented subtitle cropping and
     temporarily disabled subtitle cropping.
   * ./modules/codec/spudec/render.c: split RenderSPU into chroma-specific
     functions.

2002-11-06 Wednesday 15:41  jobi

   * modules/access/vcd/vcd.*: added entry points support (sort of
     chapters).
   * modules/gui/gtk/gtk_callbacks.c: added some locks to the
     navigation functions

2002-11-06 Wednesday 14:44  sam

   * ./modules/demux/avi/avi.c, ./modules/demux/avi/libavi.c: additional
     endianness fixes, spelling fixes, reworked return values usage, used
     C99 types.

2002-11-06 Wednesday 09:26  sam

   * ./src/misc/extras.c: removed a duplicate calculation inside a macro.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: fixed a bug causing all commandline targets to be ignored
     for playback except the last one.
   * ./modules/codec/dv.c: we detach p_vout before quitting.
   * ./modules/codec/xvid.c: fixed image corruption, added a direct rendering
     option which doesn't work yet.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 23:48  gbazin

 * modules/demux/avi/*: should theoretically fix the endianness issues with
    the avi demuxer.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 22:53  sam

   * ./modules/codec/xvid.c: beginning of a video decoder using the Xvid codec
     from xvid.org; compile with --enable-xvid --with-xvid-tree=..., run with
     --codec xvid,any (the priority is lower than ffmpeg's for the now).

     todo list: direct rendering, better buffer handling, see why only I frames
                are rendered OK here... probably more.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 21:57  gbazin

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: should theoretically work on Big Endian machines now.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 18:25  gbazin

 * All: moved the check for "video" and "audio" config variables to
    input_SelectES(). That allows --no-video and --no-audio to automagically

  Just a word: now we cannot update anymore p_input->p_current_data
 without updating i_tell. I known that it's used for skipping some bytes in
 mp3 demux (not yet fixed), I don't known if it's used elsewhere....

2002-10-26 Saturday 15:24  gbazin

 * ALL: p_selected_area->i_tell is now update inside input_SplitBuffer instead
    of inside the pf_read functions of access plugins. That means i_tell now
    actually reflects the position of what is being decoded and furthermore it
    is updated more often.

   * ./modules/video_output/directx/events.c: support for drawing in a parent
     window instead of creating our own; still a bit flakey.

   * ./mozilla/vlcshell.cpp: we can now compile the Mozilla plugin so that it
     does not call libvlc (for testing purposes).

    according to the size of an audio sample.
    For buggy OSS drivers, we now take into account the real size of the OSS
    internal buffer when we check how much this buffer has been filled.

     goal is to provide dependencies for shared libraries.

2002-10-25 Friday 09:21  sam

     to use these types from now. Of course the old types are still available

     For the moment it spawns a separate window and seems to behave nastily
     (read: crashes) when the target has sound, but the javascript interface
     works perfectly, for instance.

     To build it, I installed Mozilla development files in my mingw32 dir
     and hacked mozilla-config so that it uses these files. I also hacked
     jri_md.h and jni_md.h to put "defined(_MSC_VER) || defined(__MINGW32__)"
     where it read "defined(_MSC_VER)". No other changes were necessary.

     trigger callback themselves, to any level. The main restriction is that
     you shouldn't meddle with a variable that is already being triggered by

2002-10-14 Monday 16:46  sam

   * ./include/vlc/vlc.h, ./src/libvlc.c: added VLC_Error() to the libvlc API.
   * ./include/main.h: removed p_vlc->i_status because it was not sufficient

     separately upon destruction.
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: fixed a signed/unsigned bug that prevented creation
     of VLC_OBJECT_GENERIC objects.

   * ./src/misc/variables.c: added the VLC_VAR_COMMAND type which is simply a
     variable that stores a function pointer, and calls it when var_Get is
     called for it. The function argument is taken in val.psz_string.
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: vlc_dumpstructure and vlc_liststructure are no longer
     exported to the rest of the program; instead, they're VLC_VAR_COMMAND vars
     ("tree" and "list").
   * ./modules/control/rc/rc.c: moved a few commands to VLC_VAR_COMMAND vars.

2002-10-14 Monday 16:35  sam

   * ./src/misc/error.c: added vlc_error, a strerror() equivalent.

2002-10-14 Monday 16:34  sam

   * ./modules/misc/testsuite/test4.c: added a stress test module; doesn't get
     compiled yet because it uses the "command" variables I'm about to check
     in. They need to be typed in the rc interface for instance (-I rc). This
     module has two available commands: "signal <int>" which sends the given
     signal to the vlc process, and "stress [<int>]" which performs a series of
     object creation/lookup/destruction, variable creation/setting/destruction
     and thread spawning/joining tests. The optional argument for stress is an
     integer between 1 and 200 (the bigger, the heavier the tests; it may hang
     your machine at around 150, be careful).

  modules/demux/util/id3*: fixed up some dead comments
  modules/gui/kde/*: only set variable the user actually have changed when
 apply is pressed in the preferences window.

2002-10-12 Saturday 23:15  alexis

 Fixed a bug in the developer doc : hacking.xml and overview.xml were
 identical ! So I removed hacking.xml...

2002-10-12 Saturday 21:31  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: fix for the mingw32 build. The gtk plugin may also need mingwex.
 * modules/demux/mpeg/ts.c: added an #include <stdint.h> to make mingw32 happy when
    compiled with libdvbpsi.
 * Makefile.am: fixed dependency problem with share/vlc_win32_rc.rc.

2002-10-12 Saturday 21:26  gbazin

 * configure.in: fix for the mingw32 build. The gtk plugin may also need mingwex.
 * plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_ts.c: added an #include <stdint.h> to make mingw32 happy.

2002-10-12 Saturday 20:09  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: fix for the mingw32 build. We check if we need to explicitly
    link with the mingwex library (needed for dirent support with new mingw32
    runtimes).

2002-10-12 Saturday 19:59  gbazin

 * configure.in: slight modifications to the last mingw32 build fix.

2002-10-12 Saturday 19:47  gbazin

    link with the mingwex library (needed for dirent support with new mingw32
    runtimes).

2002-10-12 Saturday 12:24  titer

 Rewritten BeOS audio output for audio output 3. It now "pulls" the data.
 Sound is yet choppy (I don't know why).

2002-10-11 Friday 23:44  massiot

 * Updated FAQ.

2002-10-11 Friday 23:44  massiot

 * Updated FAQ.
 * Updated project files for 0.4.5 release.

2002-10-11 Friday 22:32  sam

 Changes to the libvlc API:
   * ./include/vlc/vlc.h: changed the naming conventions for libvlc. Now
     exported functions start with VLC_ instead of vlc_ to avoid conflicts.
   * ./include/vlc/vlc.h: removed the vlc_object_t, vlc_list_t, vlc_error_t
     and vlc_t types; they are now internal types only.
   * ./include/vlc/vlc.h: merged the reentrant and non-reentrant libvlc
     calls. In non-reentrant mode, we just use 0 as the first argument. In
     reentrant mode, we use an object's ID. (see below)

 Internal changes:
   * ./src/libvlc.c, ./src/misc/objects.c: instead of manipulating vlc_object_t
     pointers, we manipulate their i_object_id. When needed, an object is
     retrieved using vlc_object_get (I hope the lookup isn't too expensive,
     that's why I designed the pp_objects layout to allow log2(n) seeks).
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: activated the per-object variable storage. Unused
     yet, unless you want to try "getfoo" and "setfoo blablah" in vlc -I rc.
   * ./include/vlc_objects.h: moved the vlc_object_t and vlc_list_t definitions
     here.

 Misc:
   * ./src/vlc.c, ./mozilla/vlcshell.cpp: removed inclusion of config.h in
     code portions not part of libvlc; it was just required for the
     COPYRIGHT_MESSAGE string which is now available from VLC_Version().

2002-10-11 Friday 21:17  sam

   * ./plugins/filter/deinterlace.c: fixed the green bottom line in the
     linear deinterlace mode, thanks to Marian Durkovic <md@bts.sk>.

2002-10-11 Friday 17:29  gbazin

 * INSTALL.win32: removed note about running in administrator mode to play
    a DVD. Updated doc about using cygwin for compiling.

2002-10-11 Friday 12:50  sigmunau

 added some coloring to the messages window in the kde interface

2002-10-11 Friday 11:05  sam

   * ./src/misc/variables.c, ./include/variables.h: a few functions for
     in-object variable storage. Unused yet (not even compiled).

2002-10-11 Friday 10:08  gbazin

 * src/misc/modules.c: fixed a memory leak with the "plugin-path" config option.
 * modules/audio_output/directx.c, modules/audio_output/waveout.c: ported the directx
    and waveout audio plugins to the new changes in the audio output layer.
 * configure.ac.in: fixes for cygwin compilation, and the gtk plugin under mingw32.

2002-10-11 Friday 09:01  gbazin

 * src/interface/main.c, src/misc/modules.c: added a quick hack for a
    --plugin-path command line option.
 * INSTALL.win32: removed note about running in administrator mode to play
    a DVD.

2002-10-10 Thursday 23:11  titer

 Some clean-up. Playlist works again.

2002-10-10 Thursday 22:50  massiot

 * Updated 0.4.5 Changelog.
 * Bumped up revision number to 0.4.5.
 * Do not use vasprint on Mac OS X because X.1 doesn't have that.

2002-10-10 Thursday 22:46  massiot

 Do not use vasprintf under Mac OS X because OS X.1 doesn't have that (how
 lame...).

2002-10-10 Thursday 19:34  sigmunau

  messages.cpp: use append(...) and not setText( text() + ...), seems to
 decrease cpu-usage considerably.
  preferences.cpp: allow config strings to be 40 characters long instead of
 10. Is that enough?

2002-10-10 Thursday 17:25  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: dropped the use of typeset in favor of eval to
     set variable values (ash doesn't have typeset).

2002-10-09 Wednesday 22:54  massiot

 * (Hopefully) fixed S/PDIF outputs ;
 * Finally fixed the audio problem on most platforms.

2002-10-09 Wednesday 15:29  stippi

2002-10-09 Wednesday 01:14  titer

 BeOS compilation fixes.

2002-10-08 Tuesday 22:48  massiot

 OS X : raised the priority of the intf at the same level as the video, since
 otherwise we can't quit the application any longer...

2002-10-08 Tuesday 18:10  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.c, ./src/misc/messages.c: due to horrible user threats,
     only two levels of -v are now possible: -v for warnings, -vv for debug
     messages (-q for no output at all).

2002-10-08 Tuesday 16:02  sam

   * ./src/input/input.c: do not try to use stream output if the "sout" variable
     is set to the empty string (happens when doing "Apply" in a GUI).

2002-10-07 Monday 21:58  massiot

 * HACKING : documentation for the automake crash

 - control.gpe : depends on gpe specific libraries (gpe.handhelds.org) for familiar v0.6 and onwards.
 - control.opie : depends on qt embedded libraries (opie.handhelds.org) for familiar v0.6 and onwards.

2002-10-06 Sunday 19:35  jpsaman

 Updated rules

2002-10-06 Sunday 19:28  gbazin

   ./src/misc/netutils.c: GetMacAddress Darwin support
   ./src/libvlc.h: Default to en0 instead of eth0 under Darwin

2002-10-05 Saturday 17:29  gbazin

 * ALL: Splitted the directx plugin into an audio and video module.

2002-10-05 Saturday 03:44  bozo

 Up-to-date ALSA audio output module.

2002-10-05 Saturday 00:10  jlj

   ./extras/MacOSX/.../MainMenu.nib: added Open Target panel
   ./modules/gui/macosx/open.[mh]: Open Target code

2002-10-04 Friday 18:07  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: removed now unnecessary --force-exe-suffix flag.
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: structure_lock is now local.
   * ./src/misc/threads.c: implemented named mutexes which provide a handy
     way to protect data across plugins which might be sharing the same
     resources. Thread-unsafe libraries come to mind, but we can imagine
     using a named mutex for configuration files, or special devices.
   * ./include/main.h: removed global_lock because of vlc_mutex_need, removed
     p_global_data because it was never used, removed structure_lock because
     it did not belong here.

2002-10-04 Friday 14:02  sam

   * ./modules/gui/macosx/vout.m: if no MacOS X interface is available when
     the video output is initialized, we wait for a while before giving up;
     also changed the code so that it probes all interface objects rather than
     the first one it finds.

2002-10-04 Friday 13:13  sam

   * ./bootstrap: we use the proper linker for plugin compilation.
   * ./modules/misc/testsuite/*: moved the null module into three test modules
     that are only built when --enable-testsuite is activated. This directory
     can be a good place for compilation tests or performance benchmarks.

2002-10-04 Friday 12:01  gbazin

 * src/misc/threads.c, src/misc/win32_specific.c, include/interface.h: fixed typos.
 * configure.ac.in, modules/gui/gtk/gtk.c: Added a NEED_GTK_MAIN macro to the compiler
    flags for the gtk module. When this macro isn't defined, then the gtk module
    doesn't make use of the gtk_main module. I had to do this change because the
    gtk_main trick can't work on win32 and render the whole gtk interface unusable.

2002-10-03 Thursday 22:14  massiot

 * Backported RTP access module from HEAD.
 * Fixed a compile issue in the HTTP plug-in.

2002-10-03 Thursday 21:45  massiot

 vlc launch script for opie.

2002-10-03 Thursday 21:10  jpsaman

 file vlc.opie was initially added on branch v0_4_1_branch.

2002-10-03 Thursday 21:01  jpsaman

 Updated for opie

2002-10-03 Thursday 20:49  jpsaman

 Fixed known bug in rtp plugin which resulted in superflous error messages.

2002-10-03 Thursday 20:46  jpsaman

 Updated AUTHOS file.

2002-10-03 Thursday 18:56  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: duplicated arguments to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to fix
     locales breakage.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: libvlc understands the VLC_VERBOSE environment variable,
     to be set between 0 and 4. Default value is 0 for a program using libvlc,
     but vlc sets it to 1 by default.
   * ./src/misc/configuration.c: -v now works the old way (-v, -vv, -vvv) as
     well as the new way (-v0, -v1, -v4). -v1 is the same as -v, and -v0 is
     the same as -q (quiet). Hope it's all understandable.

2002-10-03 Thursday 17:01  gbazin

 * FAQ: updated FAQ with config file issues.
 * configure.ac.in: use -mms-bitfields instead of -fnative-struct for
    mingw32 gcc-3.x.
 * include/interface.h, modules/misc/dummy/interface.c, modules/misc/logger/logger.c,
    modules/control/rc/rc.c: Display message on Win32 explaining how to get
    back to the GUI mode.
 * src/misc/threads.c, include/vlc_threads_funcs.h: ignore the
    win9x-cv-method config option on WinNT when fast-mutex is not enabled.

2002-10-03 Thursday 16:44  gbazin

 * FAQ: updated FAQ with config file issues.
 * configure.in, configure: user -mms-bitfields instead of -fnative-struct
    for mingw32 gcc-3.x.
 * include/interface.h, plugins/dummy/intf_dummy.c, plugins/text/logger.c,
    plugins/text/rc.c: Display message on Win32 explaining how to get back
    to the GUI mode.
 * include/threads_funcs.h, src/misc/win32_specific.c: ignore the
    win9x-cv-method config option on WinNT when fast-mutex is not enabled.

2002-10-03 Thursday 13:21  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.c, ./include/main.h: the root of all objects is now
     p_libvlc, and each p_vlc is a child of p_libvlc. Reasons for this are:

      o the module bank and the message bank only need to be initialized once,
        which gives faster loads when multiple instances of libvlc are used,
      o we allow the possibility of different p_vlc sharing objects, for
        instance the audio output,
      o the CPU detection is only done once.

     This patch is not polished yet, but I cannot do any intensive tests for
     the moment because of a bug somewhere that leaves audio output objects
     lying here and there which needs to be investigated first. The current
     major issue is that the module bank is no longer freed.

2002-10-03 Thursday 10:15  sigmunau

 Heiko Panther <heiko.panther@web.de>.

2002-10-02 Wednesday 16:02  sam

   * ./bootstrap: added a check for automake bug #326. No easy workaround is
     really possible other than patching/upgrading automake. This happens for
     automake 1.6.0 and automake 1.6.1.

   * ./bootstrap, ./Makefile.am: workarounds for automake 1.5.

2002-10-02 Wednesday 09:15  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: --enable-a52 activates a52tofloat32, not a52.
        (always re-run bootstrap when configure.ac.in has changed).

2002-10-01 Tuesday 22:34  massiot

 Fixed a bug in the OSS output I introduced yesterday.

2002-10-01 Tuesday 22:26  massiot

 For people who have several network interfaces, added a --iface-addr option

2002-09-17 Tuesday 14:56  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.c: switched the position of msg_Create() and system_Init()
     because the BeOS system_Init spawns a thread, which makes use of msg_*
     functions.
   * ./src/misc/threads.c, ./src/misc/win32_specific.c: put the detection
     of SignalObjectAndWait in the thread system initialization because
     system_Init() now happens after msg_Create().

  * all: - fix a memory leak while parsing.
         - fix a bug while playing last frames (in last chunk).
         - add seek support, not complete but usable.

2002-09-17 Tuesday 08:18  sam

   * ./mozilla/*: added hooks so that the vlc plugin is scriptable from
     javascript. It's also in C++, but we didn't have the choice.

2002-09-16 Monday 20:46  massiot

 * configure.in: Fixed detection of Qt-embedded.
 * modules/codec/a52.c: Fixed detection of A/52 sound.
 * modules/audio_filter/converter/a52tofloat32.c: Fixed a bug related to
   downmixing.
 * ALL: Added hooks for audio volume management.

2002-09-16 Monday 08:10  sam

   * ./modules/gui/gtk/gtk.glade: handled delete event for the Open window.

2002-09-15 Sunday 22:33  ipkiss

  * modules/gui/win32/preferences.cpp: added a forgotten initialization

2002-09-15 Sunday 20:54  jpsaman

 Configure option --enable-qte works now (default is disabled).
 Porting video out plugin/builtin for Qt Embedded to CVS is not complete. (Please do not use it.)

2002-09-15 Sunday 19:32  jpsaman

 Hide progressbar widget on startup.

2002-09-14 Saturday 20:51  stef

 *Fixed a bug that prevented OSS from closing cleanly in spdif.

2002-09-14 Saturday 20:50  stef

 *Fixed a typo that made spudec selection fail.

2002-09-13 Friday 22:38  massiot

 (Temporary) end of the audio output 3 documentation.

2002-09-11 Wednesday 23:10  stef

 .Quick hack to make spdif work with emu10k1 oss driver. Still buggy.

2002-09-11 Wednesday 23:08  stef

 .Fixed the length of the spdif frame.

2002-09-10 Tuesday 12:58  sam

   * ./modules/misc/dummy/vout.c: fixed an endianness issue in the commandline
     chroma parsing.

2002-09-10 Tuesday 12:15  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: if we do not own the X window, like
     in the Mozilla plugin, we do not try to unmap it.

2002-09-09 Monday 13:52  sam

   * ./configure.in: the DV module is now a plugin, with the proper
     dependencies in debian/control.

2002-09-08 Sunday 22:20  massiot

 Three lines :).

2002-09-06 Friday 23:15  massiot

 Aout3 developer documentation, cont'd.

2002-09-04 Wednesday 21:44  massiot

 Beginning of the developer documentation for audio output 3.

2002-09-04 Wednesday 21:18  jpsaman

 Little cleanup action.

2002-09-04 Wednesday 21:13  jpsaman

 Qt Embedded video out patch courtesy of Gerald Hansink.
 Ported Qt Embedded video out to vlc-0.5.0 (it is not useable yet).

2002-09-04 Wednesday 21:09  jpsaman

 Renamed --enable-qte switch for Qt Embedded interface support to --enable-opie.
 Reused --enable-qte for Video Out support under Qt Embedded.

2002-09-03 Tuesday 12:03  tcastley

 Added Stephan Assmus who is helping with the BeOS Code

2002-09-03 Tuesday 12:00  tcastley

 src/misc/beos_specific.cpp:
 - Implemented VlcApplication::RefsReceived()
 - this added ability to open a file by dropping its icon onto the vlc icon
 - this makes Open With... work as well
 plugins/beos/intf_beos.cpp
 - A message is sent to be_app when the interface is created
 	(needed to support BApplication::RefsReceived())
 plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp
 - reacts on Escape and Tab key to switch fullscreen/window mode
 - blanks cursor when no activity
 - Fixed a memory leak in VideoWindow::ScreenChanged()
 - Fixed the ugly scrambled video content before any decoding actually begins
 - Added selectable aspect ratio correction
 - Added better error handling when setting the drawing mode
 plugins/beos/InterfaceWindow.h/.cpp

2002-09-02 Monday 23:21  massiot

 Fixed the trivial channel mixer.

2002-09-02 Monday 23:17  massiot

 The liba52 "codec" is now an audio filter. It means we are now able to
 autodetect S/PDIF hardware support and the audio output plug-in chooses
 the best one. Of course it probably breaks existing output modules, see
 oss.c for hints :).

 Also include minor tweaks which will entitle us to decode and output 5.1
 audio. It may break existing plug-ins, too. See
 audio_output.c:aout_FormatNbChannels for hints.

2002-09-01 Sunday 21:20  massiot

 Added a priority for video decoders, for systems with fixed-priority
 policy.

2002-08-31 Saturday 22:10  stef

 *It seems that the setting of the fragment size was buggy.

 OSS work with my sblive! now :). It still works on my other computer too
 but please test.

2002-08-31 Saturday 19:58  stef

 *Make pf_setformat disappear from sdl module.

2002-08-30 Friday 23:27  massiot

 aout3 API change :
 pf_setformat disappears (it was never called independantly of Open). If
 the format needs to be changed, we will have Close/Open. This is much
 simpler than before. Please check that I didn't break some plug-ins.

2002-08-30 Friday 22:22  massiot

 * demuxes: Worked around a bug in old VLC and VLS by changing TS stream types
   (see my last mail).
 * aout: Rewrote our whole lock policy. The output thread now doesn't require
   the mixer_lock, which might avoid delays. We will also be able to change
   the filter pipelines at runtime.

2002-08-30 Friday 19:16  sam

   * ./include/vlc_threads_funcs.h, modules/video_output/directx/vout.c: Win32
     compilation fixes (typo, undeclared var).

2002-08-30 Friday 12:23  sam

   * ./configure.in: do not try to link with -lrt if not using pthreads. This
     might break the HP/UX or Solaris ports, please check if possible.
   * ./src/misc/threads.c: fixed syntax in the st and pth implementations.

2002-08-29 Thursday 23:53  massiot

 * ./bootstrap : Fixed an issue with old shell versions
 * ALL : Added a priority argument to vlc_thread_create(), so that audio
 and input threads can run with a higher real-time priority, on systems
 allowing you to use priorities.

2002-08-29 Thursday 22:29  ipkiss

 The win32 interface is preparing for the internationalization.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 22:44  massiot

 * Fixed libmad's output volume.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 22:25  massiot

 * Finally fixed the segfault when resampling.
 * Reactivated the A/52 demux.
 * Wrote a real full-featured float32 mixer.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 21:40  sam

   * ./Makefile.old: fixed the automatic dependency rule (include dirs missing).

2002-08-28 Wednesday 19:48  massiot

 It now works when there is no automake-1.5 nor automake-1.6.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 15:30  sam

   * ./m4/*: added gettext m4 macros so that the configure behaviour is
     always the same.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 14:22  sam

   * Additional fixes for bootstrap when gettext isn't available.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 13:38  sam

   * ./bootstrap: fixed a shell error (replaced "if `foo`" with "if foo").

2002-08-28 Wednesday 12:50  sam

   * ./bootstrap: we should be able to bootstrap CVS even without gettext.

2002-08-27 Tuesday 21:53  sigmunau

 fixed a minor bug

2002-08-27 Tuesday 14:15  sam

   * ./HACKING: we can now use automake-1.5 instead of automake-1.6. But now
     we _really_ depend on it.
   * ./bootstrap: we don't use touch to create a file, because it doesn't seem
     to work everywhere.

2002-08-26 Monday 23:36  sam

   * ./bootstrap: we touch m4/Makefile.am so that configure doesn't complain
     about a missing m4/Makefile.in.
   * ./include/vlc_common.h: workaround for Borland's redefinition of PACKAGE.

2002-08-26 Monday 23:00  massiot

 * Miscellaneous S/PDIF fixes.
 * New NextPTS() function, to replace CurrentPTS() (gives the PTS which will
   be valid for NEXT byte).
 * Fixed mono mode in the builtin mpeg audio decoder.
 * Various fixes related to PTS calculation in audio decoders.

2002-08-26 Monday 22:54  sigmunau

 have my filter compile by default

2002-08-26 Monday 22:35  sigmunau

 An motion blur filter. --blur-factor states the degree of blurring from 1
 to 127. about 100 is cool

2002-08-26 Monday 21:46  sam

   * ./bootstrap: another fix for old versions of autoconf which don't seem
     to like the gettext m4 files.

2002-08-26 Monday 20:49  sam

   * ./configure.in: we now require autoconf 2.5x because previous versions
     don't seem to work very well if you are using autopoint, although
     gettext 0.11.5 claims to be fully backwards compatible. Welcome to
     automake hell.
   * ./bootstrap: workaround which uses gettextize if you do not have
     autopoint. We'll probably stay like this for a while, until gettext
     0.11.x (which replaces gettextize with autopoint) becomes more
     widespread. Currently this workaround seems to work, but don't expect
     a clean tarball if you make dist without having used autopoint. Welcome
     to automake hell.

2002-08-26 Monday 10:02  sam

   * ./Makefile.old, ./modules/gui/win32/win32.bpr: fixed header location
     issues in the Win32 build.

2002-08-26 Monday 09:38  sam

   * ./bootstrap: dropped the dependency on gettext 0.11.5. Now 0.10.4 is OK.

2002-08-26 Monday 09:12  sam

    (A few minor pending patches I had around)
   * ./debian/control: gnome-vlc recommends vlc-plugin-esd, and kvlc recommends
     vlc-plugin-arts.
   * ./src/misc/messages.c: message queue now prints the current object type.
   * ./modules/*: cosmetic fixes for the --long-help output.

2002-08-26 Monday 08:36  sam

   * ALL: fixed a few include directories.

2002-08-26 Monday 01:01  sam

   * Moved ./include/defs.h to ./config.h
   * Renamed ./include/config.h to ./include/vlc_config.h
   * Other misc auto* fixes.

2002-08-25 Sunday 23:18  sam

   * ALL: started the slow move to automake. For the moment, the changes are
     unnoticeable apart from the extra dependency on autoconf, automake and
     gettextize. See the new HACKING file for some information, especially if
     you don't run Linux.

     The current strategy is to have the configure script generate a nice
     automake Makefile from Makefile.am, and then clobber it with our good
     old dirty Makefile. Muahaha :-)

2002-08-25 Sunday 20:44  jpsaman

 Directory content is now read at startup.

2002-08-25 Sunday 19:27  sam

   * ./src/playlist/playlist.c: -Z flag makes playlist loop endlessly.

2002-08-25 Sunday 17:22  ipkiss

  * all: Unified behaviours using "action list" objects

2002-08-25 Sunday 16:55  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c, ./modules/audio_output/sdl.c: improved
     sound synchronization.
   * ./src/audio_output/output.c: reverted another change I previously did :-)

2002-08-25 Sunday 09:39  sam

   * ./src/audio_output/output.c: reverted my previous aout_OutputNextBuffer
     prototype change; it looks like we won't need it after all.
   * ./src/audio_output/output.c: if audio output is too slow, but we
     know there is no next packet, then we play it anyway. Rationale behind
     this is: better play a slightly wrongly dated packet than play silence,
     because it might be wrongly dated but there are chances it won't break
     audio continuity.
   * ./modules/audio_output/sdl.c: workaround for SDL's crap audio output
     system (callback gets called at random times, and no way to know the
     latency of the samples being played). Audio output is now rather good
     here, but please give feedback.
   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: we delay a bit before asking for a new
     buffer to avoid starvation.

2002-08-24 Saturday 21:35  sigmunau

  moved id3 related code to a separate utility module since several
 demuxers need it

2002-08-24 Saturday 21:11  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: we don't ask too early for a new buffer,
     but rather sleep a bit.

2002-08-24 Saturday 20:22  sam

   * ./modules/audio_filter/resampler/ugly.c: simple resampler which does not
     insert blank samples, but changes pitch.

2002-08-24 Saturday 17:04  gbazin

 * modules/misc/logger/logger.c: fixed initialization bugs.
 * src/misc/objects.c: in vlc_object_destroy() there's no need to lock structure_lock if
 we are the root object (structure_lock has already been destroyed anyway).

2002-08-24 Saturday 16:07  sam

   * ./modules/audio_filter/resampler/trivial.c: fixed a buffer size calculation
     issue in the trivial resampler.

2002-08-24 Saturday 14:49  sam

   * ./configure.in: fixed a typo that prevented compilation of the network
     modules.
   * ./debian/rules: added faad to the package generation.

2002-08-24 Saturday 11:57  sam

   * ./modules/gui/gtk/open.c: the Gtk and GNOME interfaces no longer ignore
     the "dvd", "frequency" and "symbol-rate" variables.

2002-08-24 Saturday 11:46  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: fixed a bug on module reopening.
   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: we now properly set the fragment size.

2002-08-24 Saturday 10:19  sam

   * ./src/audio_output/output.c: added an argument to aout_OutputNextBuffer
     which lets the audio output module give a timeout value for buffer
     delivery. This fixes a few issues with aout modules which were calling
     aout_OutputNextBuffer way too early.

2002-08-24 Saturday 09:55  sam

   * ./debian/*: created legacy packages for smooth upgrades to the upcoming
     0.5.x version, and created the vlc-plugin-svgalib package.

2002-08-24 Saturday 01:14  sigmunau

  fixed an off by factor 10 error. Noted along the way that this module
 seems to be requesting audio some time before the output pipeline is
 finnished

2002-08-23 Friday 14:16  tcastley

 Rewritten aout3.  BeOS currently PUSHES the audio.

2002-08-23 Friday 14:05  sam

   * ./modules/codec/faad/decoder.c: the AAC decoder is in sync with aout3.
   * ./modules/codec/a52old/a52old.c: the a52old decoder as well.

2002-08-22 Thursday 17:14  sam

   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/fixed32tofloat32.c: fixed conversion.
   * ./modules/codec/mad/libmad.c: ported to the latest aout changes. Still
     doesn't work here, though.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 23:19  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h: declared aout_fifo_t.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 23:17  sam

   * ./include/aout_internal.h: exported aout_FifoPop to plugins.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 22:41  massiot

 Big round of fixes in the aout3.
 * Audio and video should now _always_ be perfectly in sync.
 * Changes in a52.c (end_date management) must be ported to other codecs,
   otherwise mixer errors will appear.
 * Audio output plug-in can now tell whether they can handle a little
   clock drift (for instance, inserting zeroes after a pause).

2002-08-21 Wednesday 19:30  jpsaman

 Stopping vlc from the Familiar interface is possible again.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 17:31  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: if a plugin requested not to be unloaded, then we
     won't unload it. This makes us more fault-tolerant with crap libraries
     that are making use of atexit().
   * ./configure.in: svgalib can now be a plugin.
   * ./modules/misc/gtk_main.c: gtk_main doesn't need g_atexit anymore.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 15:55  sam

   * ./modules/misc/gtk_main.c: fixed a minor compilation warning.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 15:53  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h: we don't set _() and N_() in Gnome-enabled modules
     because <gnome.h> already does it for us.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 15:10  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/svgalib.c: SVGAlib video output module.

     Currently only supports 256 color output, and defaults to 320x200. You need     to be root to use it, it may leave your console in an unusable state, lock
     up your video card, it will segfault at exit if you compile it as a plugin
     because of SVGAlib's ludicrous use of atexit() and signal().
     Apart from these few glitches, it's rather OK, use "-I dummy -V svgalib"
     to activate. Q or Esc to quit (press for a long time if it doesn't work).

2002-08-21 Wednesday 11:07  xav

 Fixed a polioterie in the previous commit

2002-08-21 Wednesday 09:27  sam

   * ./modules/codec/a52old/a52old.c: ported the old A52 decoder to aout3.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/s16tofloat32.c: converter needed for
     a52old, includes the walken trick and b_in_place = true.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 09:26  xav

 * libvlc.c : Win32 compilation fix.
 * modules.c : we now check the directory plugins/ to find some plugins.
 (this will allow us to use the packager / installer which wasn't aware
 of plugins -> modules :)

2002-08-20 Tuesday 22:11  stef

 *Set output format to AOUT_FMT_SPDIF when in spdif mode.

 S/PDIF does not work here in oss though (output starving).

2002-08-20 Tuesday 21:10  sam

   * ./modules/gui/gtk/display.c: changed the configuration callbacks so that
     all instances of a module get changed when options such as gtk-tooltips
     or gnome-toolbartext are toggled.

2002-08-20 Tuesday 21:02  sam

   * ./modules/gui/qnx/*: ported the QNX audio output to the new API, courtesy
     of Pascal Levesque.

2002-08-20 Tuesday 18:25  sam

   (compilation fixes for my previous commit)

2002-08-20 Tuesday 18:08  sam

   * ./modules/misc/gtk_main.c: created the gtk_main module, which simply runs
     gtk_main() in its own thread, and does nothing on subsequent calls. This
     ensures that gtk_main is only running once.
   * ./modules/gui/familiar/*, modules/gui/gtk/*: the familiar, gtk and gnome
     modules are now fully reentrant thanks to their use of the gtk_main module.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: implemented vlc_set(), a wrapper for config_Put* available
     to external programs.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: removed vlc_stop() and vlc_end(), everything is now done
     by vlc_destroy().
   * ./modules/control/rc/rc.c: implemented a few new functions. For instance,
     run "vlc -I rc" and then type "intf gtk" or "intf gnome". You can even
     launch several of them. "segfault" works, too.

2002-08-20 Tuesday 12:32  sam

   * ./modules/gui/familiar/familiar.c: added a timer to check when the
     familiar interface is asked to quit.

2002-08-19 Monday 23:12  massiot

 More changes in the date handling. Should be more tolerant with
 pause/play and change of audio channel.

2002-08-19 Monday 23:07  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/*: ported the ALSA, aRts, esd and OSS modules to
     the latest aout3 changes.

2002-08-19 Monday 21:54  massiot

 * Fixed BeOS output ;
 * Fixed a few boolean_t.

2002-08-19 Monday 21:31  massiot

 * ./configure: Fixed double detection of gethostbyname.
 * Major changes in the handling of dates in the audio output ; still buggy,
 but differently.
 * Fixed a major bug in the aout pre-filters, preventing to run any other
 decoder than liba52.
 * p_aout->output.pf_play now has only one argument.

2002-08-19 Monday 17:07  bozo

   * modules/audio_output/alsa.c: we now open the device in SetFormat because
     it depends on the audio format. Cosmetic changes. The S/PDIF output may
     work.

2002-08-19 Monday 11:51  tcastley

 Fixed segfault.  Now fails to load due to incorrect format.
 Getting there :)

2002-08-19 Monday 11:37  sam

   * ./src/misc/cpu.c: we use void(*)(int) instead of sighandler_t because
     mingw32 doesn't know about sighandler_t.

2002-08-19 Monday 11:13  sam

   * ./src/misc/cpu.c: libvlc now plays nice with SIGILL and restores the
     signal handler to its previous value after use.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: moved signal handling to vlc.c.

2002-08-19 Monday 08:30  sam

   * ./modules/visualization/xosd/xosd.c: support for libxosd 1.0.0.
   * ./configure.in: added check for libxosd version.

2002-08-19 Monday 08:19  gbazin

 * modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: fixed a bug related to the size of the
 fullscreen window. We also unmap the current window when switching to fullscreen.

2002-08-18 Sunday 20:36  jpsaman

 - File and directory listing show unix permissions.

2002-08-18 Sunday 16:17  titer

 Enhanced BeOS icon ;)

2002-08-18 Sunday 14:33  sigmunau

 removed a line used during debugging

2002-08-18 Sunday 14:11  sigmunau

  the mp3 demux now parses id3 tags into the info structures if libid3tag
 is available

2002-08-18 Sunday 13:49  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.c: removed the simple signal handler because it's not
     really needed, and we were calling pthread_mutex_lock from it.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: released a vlc_list_t that caused vlc --list to hang.

2002-08-18 Sunday 13:16  sigmunau

 doxygen documented my code

2002-08-18 Sunday 13:14  sigmunau

  modules/gui/kde/interface.cpp: made the kde interface look for the rc
 file in DATA_PATH
  modules/gui/kde/kde.cpp and interface.h: removed a stupid class, moved
 stuff from open() to run() to make the kde interface start without
 segfaults.

2002-08-18 Sunday 11:32  titer

 Fixed a few linking BeOS problems (-lm, -lstdc++.r4...).

 Now everything should compile with every gcc with no problem (mp4, ffmpeg
 and faad plugins, especially).

2002-08-17 Saturday 15:35  fenrir

  * all : mpeg_audio decoder works now with aout3.

2002-08-17 Saturday 13:33  jpsaman

 Added filetype information.

2002-08-17 Saturday 13:26  tcastley

 This now compiles in BeOS.  Probably others, the i was not declared.

2002-08-17 Saturday 08:46  tcastley

 At least it compiles now.  :-)

   * ./modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: we include Xmd.h before dpms.h
     (compilation fix for Solaris).

 Up to date ALSA information.

2002-08-16 Friday 12:31  sam

2002-08-16 Friday 03:07  sam

   * ./modules/codec/spudec/*: split spudec into the parsing and the rendering
     functions.
   * ./modules/demux/mpeg/audio.c: at least three PS startcodes are required
     before we abort the parsing and consider the input as PS instead of MP3.

   * configure.in, configure: put back the ALSA audio output module in
     configure.

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: compilation fix.
   * ./modules/gui/win32/preferences.cpp: the Win32 interface doesn't use the
     old module linked list anymore.

2002-08-15 Thursday 12:11  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: the module linked list is going bye bye. We now use
     the vlc_object_* and vlc_list_* functions to manage modules. The Win32
     interface doesn't build, but I'll fix this.

2002-08-15 Thursday 10:31  bozo

2002-08-14 Wednesday 21:50  jpsaman

 Changes in familiar interface:
 - added GtkCList instead of GtkList.
 - added first column sorting order by clicking on column header
 - selecting item from list works
 - reading entire directory list is displayed in GtkCList widget

2002-08-14 Wednesday 17:06  sam

   * ./src/misc/objects.c: implemented vlc_list_find() which works like
     vlc_object_find() but returns a list of _all_ the matching objects. Only
     works with FIND_ANYWHERE at the moment.
   * ./modules/gui/gtk/preferences.c, ./modules/gui/kde/preferences.cpp,
     ./modules/gui/win32/preferences.cpp: the module lists in the preferences
     menus work again.
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: added a missing sizeof that caused crashes because
     the reindexing of the global object array was incomplete.
   * ./include/modules_inner.h: propagated the module long description to its
     submodules.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 13:10  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/esd.c: compilation fix (aout_FormatTo is obsolete).
   * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c, ./src/audio_output/mixer.c: fixed a
     horrible sound issue by making sure internal buffers have a size multiple
     of 4 bytes. Waiting for a real fix made in Meuuh, of course.

   . Simple RTP access module : only supports TS payload.
     This first draft is made to read RTP streamed by the vls.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 08:17  sam

   * ./modules/control/rc/rc.c: 'l' outputs a list of all allocated objects,
     just as 'd' displayed a tree of attached objects.
   * ./src/misc/modules.c: added a missing header.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 00:43  massiot

 * Added a third argument to aout_OutputNextBuffer. In case the buffer
   received does not start exactly at the given date, it indicates if the
   output plug-in is able to compensate for the drift (for instance on
   startup, or with S/PDIF packets), or if we need the aout core to
   resample the coming buffers. It is currently unimplemented.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 00:23  massiot

 * Changed aout_FormatTo* ; aout_FormatToSize does no longer exist.
   p_buffer now has a i_nb_bytes member. It is possible to indicate for a
   format its byterate (necessary for AC3 and SPDIF).
 * S/PDIF output seems to be working at last (tested with the file output).

2002-08-13 Tuesday 22:42  massiot

 * New float32to* converter modules, courtesy of Xavier Maillard
   <zedek@fxgsproject.org>.
 * Fixed a bug in float32tos16, where gcc over-optimized a little and
   caused problems on some platforms (eg. solaris).

2002-08-13 Tuesday 20:28  fenrir

  * clean up some code, add "mp3" short cut.
    And now if this demux has been forced it will (try) to play the whole
 file even if the stream is heavily corrupted (like PS demux).
    But now, it makes less assumptions on the stream, so report any
 problem if it mis-recognizes others files as mpeg audio (specially PS file).

2002-08-13 Tuesday 16:11  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/arts.c: ported the aRts module to aout3.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/*: fixed a bug in all the converters
     test routines (thx Meuuh).

2002-08-13 Tuesday 14:53  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/esd.c: we now properly use the esd_get_latency()
     return value to avoid audio starvation.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/*: a little loop optimization trick.
   * ./src/audio_output/aout_ext-dec.c: removed this deprecated file.

2002-08-13 Tuesday 13:15  sigmunau

 ./modules/control/rc/rc.c: fixed a segfault when pressing 'i' with no
 input

2002-08-13 Tuesday 11:59  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: we spare a variable by using p_aout->b_die
     instead of our own variable.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/a52tospdif.c, ./modules/codec/a52.c: added
     <unistd.h>, required for bswap.
   * ./modules/demux/mp4/libmp4.c: removed an unneccessary semicolon in a
     macro definition.
   * ./modules/audio_output/esd.c: first attempt at getting esd to work.
   * ./modules/video_output/*: split sdl.so into a video and an audio plugin,
     and removed useless subdirectories.
   * ./modules/audio_output/sdl.c: compilation fix.

2002-08-12 Monday 22:48  massiot

 author does still not contain this header.

2002-08-12 Monday 17:00  fenrir

  * all : enable aac demux by default.

2002-08-12 Monday 16:59  fenrir

  * all : a demux for aac stream ( raw aac with adts headers ). For now
 it has a capability equal to 0 because it conflicts with PS, so you need
 to force it.

   ./Doxyfile: a sample doxygen configuration file. Have a look at
 http://s253c.studby.ntnu.no/vlc/html/index.html to see what doxygen can

   ./doc/doxygen: a place for doxygen to put it's files

2002-08-12 Monday 09:34  sam

   * ./src/misc/objects.c: two big changes in the object API: now objects can
     only have one parent, because I don't want to deal with cycles, and each
     created object is indexed in a global array. This feature is unused yet,
     but it will speed up vlc_object_find(FIND_ANYWHERE).
   * ./debian/rules: activated the faad codec.
   * ./doc/fortunes.txt: new fortune cookies.
   * ./modules/codec/mpeg_video/headers.c: reduced the use of attach/detach.
   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: fixed two compilation warnings.

 twice).
 * src/misc/win32_specific.c: missing initializations.

 * modules/video_output/directx/aout.c: adapted the directx audio plugin to aout3.
 * modules/audio_output/waveout.c: adapted the waveout audio plugin to aout3 and
 decreased its score so the directx plugin is selected by default.
 * configure.in: re-enabled the waveout plugin

 It's really amazing how much aout3 simplifies these plugins :)

2002-08-10 Saturday 17:53  jpsaman

   * ./modules/gui/macosx/open.m: compile fix

2002-08-06 Tuesday 20:04  massiot

2002-08-04 Sunday 22:16  fenrir

  * add compilation of postprocessing modules for ffmpeg.

2002-08-04 Sunday 22:13  fenrir

  * add post processing modules.( As defined in MPEG4 ISO) There are C,
 mmx, mmxext version, but only mmxext is really usable (other need a
  _lot_ of CPU power).

 There are new options for ffmpeg plugins :
  --ffmpeg-pp to choose postprocessing module( c, mmx, mmext or mmx2 )
  --ffmpeg-pp-q to choose quality( 0..6 )
  --ffmpeg-db-?? ( where first ? is for y or c, and the other ? for v or h )
 to force deblocking on luminance(y)/chrominance(c) horizontally or
 vertically.
  --ffmpeg-dr-? ( where ? is y or c ) to force dering on ...

2002-08-04 Sunday 21:29  sam

   * ./Makefile: make clean works again.

2002-08-04 Sunday 20:04  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: if a module name starts with "$", vlc calls
     config_GetPsz and uses the result instead.

2002-08-04 Sunday 18:39  sam

   * ./include/vdec_ext-plugins.h: removed this public header and put it
     in ./modules/codec/mpeg_video/.

2002-08-04 Sunday 17:40  sam

   * ./modules/misc/dummy/decoder.c: the dummy codec now uses GetChunk instead
     of GetBits and doesn't get stuck on high bitrate movies (thanks fenrir).

2002-08-04 Sunday 17:23  sam

   * ./modules/*: moved plugins to the new tree. Yet untested builds include
     waveout, directx, qnx, beos, win32, macosx, and the AltiVec modules.
   * ALL: removed mention of AC3 in favour of A52.
   * ./configure.in, ./Makefile*: modules can now be built deeper than 1
     directory. As a consequence, the build is even slower (but I'm fixing
     this) and make clean doesn't work anymore.

2002-08-04 Sunday 12:18  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: we now recursively parse directories when
     looking for plugins.

2002-08-04 Sunday 08:45  sam

   * ./configure.in, ./mozilla/Makefile: we link the Mozilla plugin with libXt.

   * ALL: new module API. Makes a few things a lot simpler, and we gain
     about 2000 lines of code.

     I could not test everything on every architecture, so please report
     any module breakage (especially on BeOS, OSX and QNX).

 *first version of plugin for libdvdplay. To test it, you need to have
  libdvdplay installed (available from videolan CVS), and request plugins
 compilation in the usual way:
 	--enable-dvdplay.
 Note that libdvdplay needs libdvdread and libdvdcss.

 Currently it has only been tested under linux, with gnome interface (optional)
 and xvideo output.

 What works (more or less):
  -DVD reading in some rare cases :) (title and menus),
  -Menu pause,
  -Seeking,
  -Selecting directly a specific title/chapter/angle,
  -Changing audio, sub-picture, angle during playback,
  -Interactive menus with mouse only.

 What is missing:
  -Menu buttons highlighting (needs spudec patch),
  -Keyboard interaction (needs a specific part in port specific plugins),
  -A specific interface to navigate through menus (needs that I move my ass),
  -Interactive menus won't work with other output plugins so long as they
   have not been patched to send mouse/keyboard events to vlc interface,
  -Whatever you need.

 Known bugs (bugs in libdvdplay mostly):
  -Seeking in some menus or intro titles (bad vobu map),
  -Read/seek error with some DVDs,
  -the configure needs tweaking,
  -numerous segfaults,
  -decoder/output modules locking error,
  -fuzzy colors in menus when spudec is active (default in menus).

 The plugin is not guaranteed to work anywhere outside my computer. If it break your, don't come and complain to me :).

   * ALL: decoders now use a fourcc as a probe value.
   * include/input_ext-intf.h: killed p_es->b_audio, since i_cat already fills
     its purpose.
   * include/input_ext-intf.h: killed p_es->i_type in favour of p_es->i_fourcc.
   * include/video.h: killed p_pic->p_plane->b_margin; now i_visible_pitch is
     always valid.

   * ./src/libvlc.h: replaced --mpeg-adec and --ac3-adec with --codec; see
     vlc --help for more information.

   * include/video.h: removed fourcc values which should _not_ be global
     (thanks fenrir for convincing me).
   * ALL: video output plugins use the VLC_FOURCC macro to build their fourccs.
   * ./plugins/beos/InterfaceWindow.cpp: removed the last remaining call to
     input_ChangeES.

    Things I'm not sure about and need comments:
     - I used "mpga" and "mpgv" for MPEG (1+2) audio and video fourcc values.
     - I also introduced "spu ", "lpcm" and "ac3 ".
     - I removed for instance "MP4_GetCodec" because it wasn't really
       used except for the description string. I hope this change did not
       break anything really important.
     - fenrir, I must have broken a lot of things you wrote. Sorry in advance.

   * ./src/input/input_info.c, ./src/misc/messages.c: initialized the first
     vasprintf arguments to NULL for extra safety.

2002-07-22 Monday 22:19  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: added the "any" and "none" keywords to the module
     selection string. "any" matches any module, and "none" always fails.

     You can for instance use "--vout none" to disable video output, or
     "--intf gtk,any" to use the gtk interface or any other one if gtk isn't
     available. Hope it's clear :)

 Note: the new module aims at reading ac3 streams but it works only with the
 ac3_spdif "decoder" since it is the only one which dates each frame contrary
 to the others which can't avoid a flood from the input module.

   * ALL: the first libvlc commit.

    As for video output 4, this breaks almost everything, but I'll slowly
   do what remains to be fixed during the weekend.

    Changes in vlc:
    ===============

   * vlc is now a very small program (20 lines) which uses the libvlc API;
    it is quite simple for the moment but can be extended in the future.

   * interfaces, decoders, video outputs, etc. are now almost the same
    objects (yes, I know, this is C++ redone in C) and are structured in
    a tree. More about this later, but basically it allows the following
    nice features:
     - several interfaces
     - several playlists with several outputs
     - input plugins spawning helper interfaces (will be used for DVD menus)
     - anything spawning anything; I swear there are useful uses for this!

   * libvlc can be used in other programs; I'm currently writing a Mozilla
    plugin for my employer.

    Things currently broken:
    ========================

   * most interfaces, most ports
   * the playlist handling (almost finished rewriting this though). This means
    no file can be played from the GUI, you need to use the commandline. This
    also means it segfaults at EOF, when exiting the program, and it sometimes
    refuses to open a file when asked to.

2002-06-01 Saturday 11:38  sam

   * Backported fixes from MAIN.

2002-06-01 Saturday 10:36  sam

                   in my work office :).
  * plugins/win32/* : enabled the "Eject" button (thanks Ipkiss)
  * src/misc/netutils.c : just changed my mail :P

2002-05-30 Thursday 08:17  gbazin

 * changed ADD_BOOL and ADD_BOOL_WITH_SHORT config macros to accept a
 default value as an argument.
 * modified the command line parsing to accept --foo and --no-foo when a
 "foo" boolean config option is defined.
 * modified the help menu to indicate if the option is enabled or
 disabled by default.

2002-05-29 Wednesday 18:39  sam

   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: when the video output hasn't received
     a new picture for a while, it redisplays the last displayed one. This will
     be useful for DVD menus, but also solves the "picture becomes black when
     vlc is paused" issue.

2002-05-24 Friday 12:42  gbazin

 * ./include/inpu_ext-dec.h added a check to fifo->b_die after the call
 to BitstreamNextDataPacket() in GetChunk().
 Code using GetChunk() also needs to check fifo->b_die before using the
 obtained data.
 This fixes frequent crashes you get on win32 with the a52 plugin when you
 close a stream.

2002-05-22 Wednesday 19:31  gbazin

 * ./src/misc/modules.c: restored plugins hiding as the problem is fixed.
 * ./plugins/directx/directx.c: UnregisterClass() in MODULE_DEACTIVATE. If
    we don't do this, trying to use the class when the plugin is reloaded will
    cause a segfault.

 PS: on Win32 the sdl plugin is still affected by this. It looks like SDL keeps
     an internal state which isn't updated when we reload the plugin.

2002-05-22 Wednesday 17:19  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: disabled module autohide until we find out why a
     reloaded module sometimes does not work properly.

 * Updated changelog.

2002-05-20 Monday 19:49  gbazin

 * First try for IPv6 support on Win32. This hasn't been tested so it
   might not work! To compile this stuff you need a mingw compiler with
   w32api-1.3.

 The win32 code uses the getaddrinfo function because inet_pton is
 supposed to be deprecated and not supported by Microsoft. gethostbyname2
 isn't supported as well. Maybe we could try to unify the ipv6 plugin and
 have all the ports use getaddrinfo ? (I didn't dare to do it because I
 don't want to break anything before a release ;-)

2002-05-20 Monday 19:34  sam

   * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: workaround for a bug in the dummy vout.

2002-05-20 Monday 19:12  sam

   * ./plugins/dummy/dummy.c: added --dummy-chroma option.
   * ./plugins/dummy/vout_dummy.c: the dummy vout plugin now uses vlc's
     vout_AllocatePicture instead of its own.
   * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: added YUY2 in vout_AllocatePicture.

 * added a few *_LONGTEXT descriptions to main.c
 * on win32 DVD/VCD_DEVICE defaults to to D:

 Could anyone finish the *_LONGTEXT descriptions in main.c. There aren't
 that many left right now, just the ones I didn't really know what to do
 with.
 If someone also wants to review and change the already existing
 *_LONGTEXT descriptions, he is welcome as well because there are not
 really high quality descriptions :(

 * fixed deadlock in NextFrame() in aout_pcm.c

2002-05-18 Saturday 14:03  gbazin

 * updated the MSVC++ project files and added support for dirent (vlc compiled
    with msvc can now load plugins - even compiled with mingw).
 * small portability fixes.

2002-05-18 Saturday 13:33  massiot

 * Menu item to maximize the volume in Mac OS X ;
 * Dropped dependancy on autoconf 2.52.

2002-05-18 Saturday 13:30  gbazin

 * modified the directx video plugin to try to create an YUV surface before
    falling back to an RGB surface when it's not possible to use overlays.
    Some graphic cards can do the YUV->RGB conversion in hardware during the
    blitting stage.
 * in the directx video plugin, we now request that the RGB surface be created
    in video memory. The reasoning behind this is that usually surfaces in
    video memory benefit from more hardware acceleration (like for instance
    hw rescaling, hw blitting, etc...)
 * added two options to the directx video plugin to disable the above features.
    (mainly because my video driver is buggy and doesn't handle them well).

 * small cosmetic changes to the generation of the config file.

 * fix for config_GetHomeDir() on win32. SHGetFolderPath() is located in
    shfolder.dll not shell32.dll.
 * fix for the gtk preferences dialog box. To be sure that an int or float value
    is actually changed we call gtk_spin_button_update() in the
    GtkInt/FloatChanged() event handler.

2002-05-18 Saturday 11:59  sam

 *check for b_die and b_error in all loops so that we don't remain stuck
 waiting for data whereas the vlc has tried to quit.

2002-05-17 Friday 16:38  sam

   * ./src/misc/mtime.c: we use nanosleep whenever possible (patch from Meuuh).

   * removed a debug message that I forgot in my previous commit

2002-05-15 Wednesday 13:07  marcari

 On sam's advice I added the input_FDNetworkClose() function to be called
 when closing a  networking stream instead of input_FDClose().  It is due
 to WIN32  because we have  to call  closesocket() instead of  close() to
 close the socket. The problem was  : windows did not leave the multicast
 group when closing the socket.

   * input_ext-plugins.c : where is located the function
   * *.h : function declaration
   * udp.c, http.c : these modules now call input_FDNetworkClose()

2002-05-15 Wednesday 11:06  marcari

   * netutils.c: use closesocket() instead of close() at the end
   of the network_ChannelJoin() for WIN32.

   It closes the following bug : when changing channel we sometimes got
   a 'no answer from vlcs' even if the answer is sent back.

     try to use it, unless it was explicitely requested (--vout for example).

2002-05-14 Tuesday 19:33  bozo

 Improvements of the OS X GUI.

2002-05-06 Monday 21:05  gbazin

 * video plugins that don't handle rescaling themselves have to let the
   video_output thread know about resizing events (with VOUT_SIZE_CHANGE event).
   (this part needs some clean-up but it is basically working for the X11 and
    SDL plugins).

 * fixed fullscreen for the SDL plugin.

 * xmga and sdl now switch to fullscreen on double-click.

2002-05-05 Sunday 08:25  gbazin

   * ./include/modules_inner.h, ./src/misc/configuration.c: support for config
     options callbacks.

     They don't take any argument for the moment, but this will change when
     I'm finished with my other vlc changes. There is a little problem: the
     Gtk+ interface keeps calling Put***Variable each time we click on "Apply"
     or "Save". I think it should only call it once. Is there a way to fix
     this? Gildas? lool? :-)

2002-05-03 Friday 18:40  sam

 * introduced a memalign wrapper that will align the memory manually if
   memalign doesn't exist.

   void *vlc_memalign( size_t align, size_t size, void **pp_orig )
   where the return value is the aligned pointer and *pp_orig is the pointer
   that has to be freed afterwards.

   the arithmetic I'm doing on the pointer to align it is not portable to
   64bits architectures. If someone knows how to something portable, please
   tell me ( and no I don't want to do if(sizeof(void *) == blabla) ).

   Other little problem, I was planning to use posix_memalign by default in
   the wrapper implementation but it doesn't work (someone can tell me what
   I'm doing wrong ?)

   issues.

 * New pthread implementation for WinNT/2K/XP. This implementation shouldn't
   be subject to race conditions as it is using SignalObjectAndWait() from the
   Win32 API.
   As this should be somehow slower than the old method (still used on Win9x),
   you can specify that you want to use the old method with the "fast_pthread"
   config option.

 * Added a new p_main_sys global variable. This variable is a pointer to an
   OS specific structure which is defined in *_specific.h. This structure can
   be filled by the already existing System_Init() function and is a nice
   way to avoid too many #ifdefs.

2002-04-02 Tuesday 23:27  gbazin

 * Got rid of the DVD_DEVICE macro. We now use the dvd_device config option.
   ( this creates a small memory leak as we don't free the string obtained
     from config_GetPszVariable, but I think we can live with it for now )

 * the SSE plugins are disable on the mingw32 build as they don't work.
   ( because memalign is not implemented on win32, and malloc only aligns
     on an 8 bytes boundary )

 * fixed small mistake in INSTALL.win32

2002-04-02 Tuesday 23:22  ipkiss

  * ./include/config.h: fixed config directory name for windows
  * ./plugins/win32: the network dialog now respects the preferences settings

2002-04-02 Tuesday 23:00  massiot

 Added memcpyaltivec.

2002-04-02 Tuesday 22:46  massiot

 Compilation fix. :-ppppp

2002-04-02 Tuesday 22:16  massiot

 * Altivec-enabled version of fastmemcpy
 * Use ImageBuffer instead of ScreenBuffer in OS X video output (should be
 faster)

2002-04-02 Tuesday 21:56  ipkiss

 * ./src/interface/main.c: check that channels have been created before
   the call to network_ChannelJoin

2002-04-02 Tuesday 11:31  ipkiss

  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: small compilation fix

2002-04-02 Tuesday 10:43  tcastley

 Changed directory of the config file for BeOS to be consistant with
 OS standard.

2002-04-02 Tuesday 10:17  sam

   * ./configure.in: BeOS, liba52 and chroma plugin compilation fixes.
   * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_access.c: removed a warning.
   * ./src/misc/configuration.c: Solaris fixes by Meuuh.
   * ./FAQ: removed outdated stuff.

2002-04-01 Monday 21:54  gbazin

 * Fixes for the Win32_msvc build

2002-04-01 Monday 10:47  gbazin

 * updated the "package-win32" rule
 * all txt files are now converted to dos format (CRLF)

2002-04-01 Monday 10:13  gbazin

 * VLC-Win32 Cross-Compile Howto, courtesy of Bill Eldridge.

2002-04-01 Monday 09:59  gbazin

 * updated INSTALL.win32

2002-03-29 Friday 00:14  massiot

 Disabled the server argument in udpstream: because it confuses users and is
 not of any practical use.

2002-03-28 Thursday 21:21  massiot

 Fix for sparc.

2002-03-28 Thursday 10:17  gbazin

 * don't try to stat() the dvd drive letter on win32
 * disabled YUV overlay double buffering for now, as it seems to actually be
     slower.
 * temporary fix in vlc_cond_signal() for win32 (I really should use
     SignalObjectAndWait() on WinNT so we can avoid race conditions in the
     pthread code). This fixes a problem noticed on WinXP where vlc would
     freeze regularly and eat-up all the CPU (fun no?)

2002-03-28 Thursday 03:53  jobi

 * When unselecting an ES, we must ged rid of p_es->p_pes so that it is
   regererated when we select this ES again. It made vlc segfault when
   switching from some stream to another, or when switching program
   in satellite input.

2002-03-27 Wednesday 22:15  massiot

 * UDP access plug-in can now receive MPTS (Multiple Program TS) and switch
 programs
 * Audio and video output go to time-constrained scheduling [OS X port]

2002-03-27 Wednesday 19:54  jpsaman

 Translation of user interface messages to Netherlands.

2002-03-27 Wednesday 19:53  jpsaman

 Added Netherlands translation (nl) to configure.in

2002-03-26 Tuesday 23:39  massiot

 * GNU make detection
 * Deleted non-working fullscreen menu item [OS X]
 * udp and http no longer modify p_input->psz_name

2002-03-26 Tuesday 23:08  gbazin

 * various little portability fixes

2002-03-26 Tuesday 22:30  gbazin

 * modified the gtk interface to save an empty <string> option as a NULL pointer
 * modified config_LoadConfigFile to consider an empty <string> option as a
    NULL pointer.

2002-03-26 Tuesday 22:02  gbazin

 * changed the behaviour of the config file:
   - now all the config options are saved. <string> config options which have
   no default value are also saved in the config file but as an empty string.
   - config_LoadConfigFile will ignore empty config options, which also means
   we cannot pass an empty string as a <string> config option. (this shouldn't
   matter anyway)

2002-03-25 Monday 23:36  ipkiss

  * Added a win32 interface plugin, developed with Borland C++ Builder.
    To build the plugin, follow the instructions in INSTALL-win32.txt

  * Known bugs:
         - subtitles don't work
         - a crash occurs when the user exits by pressing 'q' in the vout
         - when moving the slider, position in the stream updates even if
           the slider isn't released yet

  * TODO list:
         - clean code in menu.cpp
         - adapt lool's enhancements of the Gtk+ preferences box
         - write drag-and-drop stuff
         - and of course, fix known bugs :)

  * For those of you who can't wait till the next release to test the win32
    interface, binary files are available here:
    http://www.via.ecp.fr/~ipkiss/intfwin/vlc.zip
    Enjoy!

2002-03-25 Monday 20:37  lool

 The "we love gibalou" commit :
   * plugins/gtk/gnome.c, plugins/gtk/gtk.c, plugins/gtk/gtk_common.h :
       . new Tooltips structure
   * plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c:
       . modifications of some widgets, the structure, cosmetic changes
   * src/interface/main.c:
       . typos
       . a couple new descriptions

2002-03-25 Monday 19:16  gbazin

 * moved the "display" option from main to the relevant plugins. ( We now have
    the x11_display, xvideo_display, xmga_display and ggi_display options ).

2002-03-25 Monday 04:18  sam

   * Fixed a little omission in INSTALL-win32.txt.

2002-03-25 Monday 02:06  jobi

 * Fixed a bug that made vlc segfault when choosing a program, change to
   another and come back to the first one.
 * Added gtk and gnome interfaces for satellite input. We should find a
   way to hide the button if satellite support is not compiled.

2002-03-22 Friday 00:55  xav

  - Updated INSTALL-win32.txt

2002-03-22 Friday 00:24  xav

  * Win32 fix.

2002-03-21 Thursday 23:49  massiot

 Miscellaneous fixes for the OS X port.

2002-03-21 Thursday 22:10  gbazin

 * the calculation for the initial video window dimensions is now done in
     video_output.c and made available into p_vout->i_window_height/width.
     This allows to get rid of duplicated code and unify the behaviour of
     the video output plugins. (not all the plugins have been modified
     because I didn't want to break anything).

     As a side effect, the --width and --height options are now working, you
     can even use only --width or only --height the other dimension will adapt
     automatically to the video characteristics.
     Note that you need to remove the width/height options from the config file
     or set them to -1 if you want to use the actual video size.

2002-03-21 Thursday 07:11  gbazin

 * moved GetConfigurationFromCmdLine() into configuration.c and renamed it
    into config_LoadCmdLine()
 * config_GetHomeDir doesn't use getpwuid_r anymore as this was creating
    some problems on solaris. This function now uses getpwuid and is called
    only once to store the home directory into the p_main structure.

2002-03-21 Thursday 02:27  jobi

 [no log message]

2002-03-20 Wednesday 23:00  gbazin

 * fixed stupid bug in stupid ConvertPrintfFormatString() function
 * fixed the "waveout not closing" bug. We need to reset the waveout device
     before closing it.

2002-03-20 Wednesday 17:44  sam

   * ./src/input/mpeg_system.c: fixed a bus error on UltraSparc.

2002-03-20 Wednesday 03:43  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: kludge to allow the ALSA module to be
     compiled as a plugin. Please test.
   * ./include/modules.h: fixed a C++ warning.

2002-03-20 Wednesday 03:12  ipkiss

  * Added 3 bugs of the win32 port to the BUGS file

2002-03-19 Tuesday 23:47  massiot

 Fixed a typo. Grmbl.

2002-03-19 Tuesday 23:44  massiot

 Better IPv6 detection. IPv6 is disabled under MacOS X (no inet_pton
 call).

2002-03-19 Tuesday 23:02  jobi

 * fixed some bugs in program management : selected ESs must be attached
 to the selected program.

2002-03-19 Tuesday 14:00  sam

   * ./plugins/network/ipv4.c: cosmetic fix.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: fixed a typo in the --help output.
   * ./src/misc/netutils.c: fixed a segfault in the vlcs communication; still
     unstable but solving other bugs won't do any good without rewriting the
     whole playlist code. Which I'm doing right now.

2002-03-19 Tuesday 00:12  massiot

 MacOS X compile fixes.

2002-03-18 Monday 21:04  xav

   * skip "//" if we find "://" in a resource we have to play : this allows us to use the syntax udpstream://host.

2002-03-18 Monday 19:14  sam

   * ./extras/MacOSX_dvdioctl: removed outdated files.
   * ./plugins/fx/scope.c: fixed an infinite loop error.
   * ./plugins: fixed segfaults in various demux plugins.
   * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: SDL_VIDEODRIVER can be specified from the

2002-03-18 Monday 17:09  sam

   * ./configure.in: fixed linking of the ipv4 plugin.

2002-03-18 Monday 16:38  xav

  * DirectX plugin is now correctly detected and configured.

2002-03-17 Sunday 21:59  sam

   * ./BUGS: updated bug list.
   * ./configure.in: ./configure --help should be a lot clearer now.

2002-03-17 Sunday 17:00  sam

   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb8.c: plain C 8 bpp transformation.
   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: plain C 24/32 bpp transformations.
   * ./plugins/ggi/ggi.c: support for 8 bpp displays.
   * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: support for 8 bpp displays.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: support for 8 bpp displays.
   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a segfault.

2002-03-17 Sunday 11:12  gbazin

 * small fix for the config file. The parser assumes that the config file is
 divided into sections (a section is the config data for a plugin and begins
 with something like [foo]), so the comment for the beginning of the section
 must be after the section marker and not before.

 If you want to illustrate the problem (without this fix):
 - save vlc's config
 - exit from vlc and remove for example the dsp plugin (rm plugins/dsp.so)
 - resave vlc's config
 and now look at the end of the config file, it's all screwed up.

2002-03-16 Saturday 23:03  sam

   * ./configure.in: more modules are plugins.
   * ./src/misc/configuration.c: changed ~/.VideoLan/vlc to ~/.videolan/vlcrc,
     and a few cosmetic changes (sorry Gildas for the butchery).
   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: C version of the I420 to RV15/16 chroma.

2002-03-16 Saturday 01:40  gbazin

 * This the last piece of the new configuration module. You can now save your
 configuration options (only from the gtk/gnome interface for now). The config
 file will be saved as ~/.VideoLan/vlc

 It's not quite yet finished (well there are a few small details to sort out),
 but I'm going away for the week-end and I wanted to commit this before so you
 can all have a play with it :)

2002-03-15 Friday 04:41  sam

   * ./Makefile: fixed OS X vlc.app compilation dependencies.
   * ./configure.in: fixed the endianness check under Solaris.

   * ./src/input/input.c: strings are now initialized to "" instead of NULL.

   * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: we now properly support the subtitle
     palette information we get from the DVD. Subtitles rox !
   * ./src/video_output/vout_subpictures.c: removed all DVD-specific routines
     and put them into spu_decoder.c.

2002-03-15 Friday 01:47  stef

 *Move iec958/spdif encapsulation from ac3_spdif to aout_spdif.
 It will eventually allows to use ac3_adec or a52 for spdif output.

 *Remove an ugly loop in aout_spdif.

2002-03-14 Thursday 01:35  stef

 *p_es->p_demux_data is available in p_config->p_demux_data so that the input
 can pass information directly to the decoder.

 *First application: aspect ratio for DVD is read from the ifo (should fix
 the buf with aspect ratio in anamorphic DVDs).

 *The DVD plugin also copy the spu yuv palette in p_demux_data so that the
 spudec can display subtitle with the right color (sam !).

 *Removed duplicate code and useless lock in gtk.

2002-03-13 Wednesday 08:41  tcastley

 Updated Tony Castley's e-mail.

2002-03-12 Tuesday 18:37  stef

 *New configuration option to choose audio output format at runtime.
 It allows to select spdif pass-through decoder with --ac3_adec and to
 remove the ugly b_ac3 in main.h

 As a consequence --spdif doesn't work anymore: you should use --ac3_adec pass

 *Fixed a typo in main.c

 *Return the option name in error message for unknown option intead of the
 argument.

2002-03-11 Monday 07:23  gbazin

 * New GTK configuration interface. This interface is generated dynamically
   at run-time from the configuration data contained in each plugin.
 * config_PutPszVariable and config_GetPszVariable are now thread safe.
 * Few modifications/optimizations to the config module.
 * Got rid of all the _VAR macros in config.h

 This is the first version of the GTK configuration interface. There are still
 a few raw corners and a fews things left to do, but it basically does what
 I wanted.
 Constructive comments like it sucks or it smells rotten fish are of course
 very welcome. And if there are GTK gurus out there, please don't hesitate to
 add your touch.

 I also started to add usefull comments to the configuration options but I'm not
 really good at this kind of thing so if people want to help, they can finish
 the job. For this look at all the *_LONGTEXT macros at the top of main.c

 (PS: Translations will also be appreciated but not right now as the interface
 will likely change again in the few coming days)

2002-03-09 Saturday 16:48  stef

 *Fixed EOF segfault at end of DVD

 *Buffer manager is renintialised at area change.

2002-03-08 Friday 00:26  bozo

 Audio output ALSA: spdif support.

2002-03-06 Wednesday 23:54  sam

   * ./src/interface/main.c: disabled the GNOME segfault dialog in debug
     mode. We want nice, clean segfaults, with huge core files and a lot
     of rattle noise.

2002-03-06 Wednesday 03:27  sam

   * ./plugins/ac3_adec/ac3_parse.c: ac3dec is now less verbose.
   * ./src/interface/interface.c: fixed a deadlock when seeking the
     stream using the keyboard arrows.

2002-03-06 Wednesday 01:20  stef

 *Removed an occurance of former angle item in gtk.

 *Fixed a bug in ES management introduced lately in DVD/DvdRead.

 *Beginning of reorganisation in DVD plugin source files, in order to try to
 make it easier to understand. There is some work left though :p.

 *Decreased the score for VCD plugin, as the VCD demuxer was used even
 for DVD :p. It should make autodetection work.
 Some comment:
 -I think that VCDInit should make a test on the access plugin and be launched
 only if the access plugin is VCD,
 -VCDOpen shouldn't set p_input->b_error: if it fails we just try another
 module,
 -PSRead doesn't need to be duplicated anymore: input_ReadPS is now available
 for plugins (cf Christophe's commit).

 Please comment around that: I'd like to know if the behaviour I've described
 is the one everyone expects.

 Enjoy my new bugs :p

2002-03-05 Tuesday 23:29  jobi

 * Modified vcd input for the new input III.
 * Still have problems with end of tracks.
 * Modified the command line, as stef did for the DVD :

  [vcd:][device][@[title][,chapter]

  Note that chapter support is not yet implemented.

2002-03-05 Tuesday 17:46  stef

 * Dvd angle is now handled through a program structure, so that the interface
 needs nothing specific to change angle.

 * Fixed a bug in clock management where ES without a program couldn't get
 timestamped.

 *Fixed program management in gnome/gtk. Program now also appears in popup.

 *In interface, only display ES associated with the selected program, or with
 no program at all.

2002-03-05 Tuesday 06:48  gbazin

 * fixed typo in the win32 change to the input parser.

2002-03-04 Monday 23:56  massiot

 * IPv6 network module, courtesy of Alexis Guillard <alexis.guillard@bt.com>,
 for BT ;
 * --6 and --4 options to force IPv6 or IPv4 (FIXME: it should be -6 and
 -4 but I don't know how to do it with the new configuration module) ;
 * Channel manager now uses a socket from the network plug-in and is more
 portable (and probably broken, too :) ;
 * input_ReadPS and input_ReadTS are now in mpeg_system.c to be more
 easily reused by plug-ins other than mpeg_ps and mpeg_ts.

 That's all for tonight.

2002-03-04 Monday 22:20  gbazin

 * this time I actually commited the win32 modif to the input parser ;-)

2002-03-04 Monday 22:18  gbazin

 * We now make sure the aout plugin buffers always contain between
 AOUT_BUFFER_DURATION/2 and AOUT_BUFFER_DURATION*3/2 worth of audio.
 This should solve the audio buffer underruns.

 * fix for the bug in input when filename contains a '@' character.

 * simplified the win32 specific changes to the input parser. ( I think
 we can safely assume that no access plugin name will have a length of
 one character)

2002-03-04 Monday 01:53  stef

 [no log message]

2002-03-03 Sunday 20:42  gbazin

  * Fixed input parser under win32, chich couldn't understand that
 c:\windows\bureau is a valid file and doesn't need to be accessed with
 the plugin 'C' :-)
  * BTW, I added myself in the AUTHORS file :)

2002-03-03 Sunday 04:37  sam

   * Got rid of int_types.h and did a few changes Ipkiss will need. Hope I
     did not break other platforms.

2002-03-02 Saturday 03:15  stef

 *Initiliaze p_access_module & p_demux_modules to NULL when input thread
 in created.

2002-03-01 Friday 16:07  sam

   * ./po/no.po: Norwegian translation by Sigmund Augdal. Berd ka p tt.
   * ./src/misc/modules.c: shortcuts for --intf work again, gvlc launches the
     Gtk interface, qvlc launches the Qt interface, etc.
   * ./plugins/fx/scope.c: we now have sound together with --aout scope.

2002-03-01 Friday 01:12  stef

 *dvd and dvdread support for input III.

 Dvdread is known to segfault at title change. I'm working on this.

2002-03-01 Friday 00:33  massiot

 Input III (Episode 1).
 - Major rewrite of the buffer core functions
 - Modularity of access plugins (file, udp, http)
 - Modularity of network stack (ipv4, soon ipv6)
 - Autodetection of the type of stream

 And a new killing feature : HTTP streams are now seekable.

 Please note that dvd, dvdread and vcd plug-ins are broken and thus disabled.

2002-02-27 Wednesday 22:57  sam

   * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/vpar_headers.c: we no longer crash when the next
     stream doesn't have the same image size as the previous one.
   * ./src/audio_output/aout_pcm.c: another overrun fix; please test.

2002-02-27 Wednesday 19:05  sam

   * ./configure.in: fixed a plugins/dsp.so compilation issue under OpenBSD.

2002-02-27 Wednesday 18:19  sam

     don't have BONE, though).

2002-02-27 Wednesday 03:47  sam

   * ./include/common.h: BeOS compile fixes.
   * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: fixed BeOS video output.

2002-02-26 Tuesday 18:25  gbazin

 * forgot to add the declaration of server_port in main.c
 * char pointers obtained by config_GetPszVariable need to be freed

2002-02-26 Tuesday 17:22  xav

 Multicast now works under Win32, but this is a _bad_ kludge.

 It still segfaults 4 secondes after the first frame, but, at least, I
 can see two or three frames from MI2 :-)

2002-02-26 Tuesday 01:17  stef

 *Reversed my previous configuration change.

 I'd better used dvd_title or so but INPUT_TITLE_VAR is also used in
 gtk_open.c and I can't find a neat way to prevent this, so I leave this
 option in main.c.

2002-02-25 Monday 23:59  sam

   * ./include/threads.h: support for the State Threads Library, a userland
     threads library (http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/). Useless to most
     people, but can be handy to debug stuff. Activate with `--enable-st'.

2002-02-25 Monday 18:42  stef

 *Adaptation to new configuration scheme for dvd, dvdread and spdif

2002-02-25 Monday 04:30  sam

   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_menu.c: fixed a compile issue on IA64.
   * ./plugins/fx/scope.c: new toy plugin, an audio scope module.

     Each time I fix a bug in vlc I feel urge to code something useless. This
     one is very, very rough for the moment, probably buggy, slow, will crash
     your blender and reboot your fridge. Screenshot can be found here:

     Activate with `--aout scope' (yes, it currently disables the real
     audio output... I'll fix this as well).

2002-02-24 Sunday 22:12  sam

   * Replacement header for aout_common.h.

2002-02-24 Sunday 22:06  sam

   * Fixed a quite old bug in the audio output which made the sound stutter
     when wrapping around the audio output fifo.
   * Lots of simplifications in the audio output, got rid of b_stereo.

 Added a menu in the GTK and gnome interfaces to change the current program
 in multi-program streams (such as ones provided by a DVB-S card).

 This is the first part of the new configuration architecture for vlc.
 Two other parts will follow soon:
 - config file implementation
 - gtk configuration interface.

 This part won't change much for end-users as these changes are mostly
 internal, you will however notice that the command line interface has
 changed. It will maybe be less user-friendly as I almost removed the
 short options but it shouldn't a big problem when the config file is
 implemented.

 What as changed is that it is really easy now to add configuration
 options to vlc. Plugins can also implement configuration options. All
 you have to do is to declare a MODULE_CONFIG section in your plugin.
 If you want to know more about this look at configuration.h and for some
 example: main.c, dsp.c or xvideo.c

 It would be nice if every developper could now start using configuration
 options in there plugins and also enhance old plugins.

 That's it, now let's hope I didn't break too many things ;-)

2002-02-23 Saturday 21:31  gbazin

 * fixed array over-run bug in intf_MsgUnsub

2002-02-22 Friday 20:46  gbazin

 * Don't try to grok altivec with mingw32.
 * --with-directx-path should now indicate the path where the actual
 headers are (before the headers had to be in an include subdir). By the
 way you can download these header files from the videolan web site.

2002-02-21 Thursday 23:56  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: if symbol foo isn't found in the
     plugin, we always try to open _foo, whatever the architecture.

2002-02-21 Thursday 00:54  sam

   * ./configure.in: gtk*-config detection fix for FreeBSD.

2002-02-20 Wednesday 23:23  sam

   * ./configure.in: removed a bashism.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: support for systems without shm.h.
   * QNX compilation fixes here and there; the qnx plugin still doesn't work.

2002-02-20 Wednesday 19:01  sam

   * ./Makefile: the win32 port now uses a more recent version of gtk+.

2002-02-20 Wednesday 05:56  sam

   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c: the log window is now black with colourful text.
   * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c: ported the log window to the GNOME interface.
   * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c: messages are sent to the queue even if
     -vvvv* wasn't specified.

2002-02-20 Wednesday 05:50  jlj

   * MacOS X VCD support.

2002-02-19 Tuesday 03:54  sam

   * ./plugins/lirc/lirc.: various fixes, thanks to Sigmund Augdal.
   * ./plugins/text/logger.c: rewrote an ugly loop.
   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c: added a Gtk+ window containing all the log
     messages; updated in real time. To open it, go to "view"->"messages".

2002-02-19 Tuesday 00:50  sam

    * Got rid of TRACE and intf_DbgMsg which were seldom used anyway.
    * All intf_*Msg functions now write to stderr.
    * Implemented a message queue interface plugins can subscribe to.
    * Wrote the logger interface plugin. Usage:
       vlc -I logger:filename.log
    * Lots of fixes in the SPU renderer.

2002-02-18 Monday 19:02  stef

 Fixed a typo in aspect ratio calculation

2002-02-18 Monday 01:34  jlj

   * MacOS X vout improvements
   * MacOS X intf now returns, allowing vlc to terminate properly
   * Added a new make target: package-macosx

2002-02-15 Friday 20:02  gbazin

 * Win32 compilation fixes (mingw includes dirent)
 * configure now checks for ddraw.h and not directx.h
 * vout_directx doesn't include directx.h anymore (this file isn't part of
     the directx sdk)
 * moved all the stuff from aout_waveout.c directly into waveout.c (I don't
     know what I was thinking about when I created these two files ;-)
 * until we fix the audio buffer underrun problem, waveout will be the
     default audio output on win32 (instead of directx).

2002-02-15 Friday 13:32  sam

   * ALL: got rid of *_Probe functions because most of them were duplicates
     of the real _Init or _Create functions. That's 1000 lines of code gained.
   * ./src/misc/modules.c: we try not to keep the global lock in module_Need,
     which should speed up output spawning.
   * ./plugins/dummy/input_dummy.c: fixed vlc:quit command.
   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_playlist.c: compilation fix.
   * ./plugins/macosx/*: preliminary fixes for the vout4 port.

    Notes on the *_Probe eradication:
   o I probably broke the DirectX video output, because of the "must init and
     run in the same thread" issue. I'll fix this ASAP.
   o Subtitles are broken (or at least, pretty ugly) in RGB mode.
   o The input plugins still have *_Probe functions. This will disappear when
     meuuh is finished with the access plugins.
   o The decoder plugins still have *_Probe functions. This is probably not
     going to change, it looks OK to me.

2002-02-14 Thursday 23:29  sam

   * Grmbl. Forgot to commit those Win32 fixes last time, and they were
     stuck on VTHR. Sorry xav, this probably explains why I couldn't
     find the commit log :-)

2002-02-13 Wednesday 22:10  sam

   * ./plugins/beos/*: BeOS fixes from Rudolf Cornelissen.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: --desync now really accepts a value in ms.
   * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: fixed a crash when not opening a VCD.
   * ./src/video_output/vout_subpictures.c: fixed subtitles under BeOS and
     other architectures which don't support overlay.

2002-02-08 Friday 15:57  sam

   * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: ported the BeOS RGB video output to
     vout4. The overlay video output still needs to be written though.

2002-02-06 Wednesday 20:44  gbazin

 * Just renamed the liba52_adec plugin into a52 to comply with the naming
 convention used by the other plugins.

2002-02-06 Wednesday 02:37  sam

   * ./plugins/lirc/lirc.c: IR remote control plugin by Sigmund Augdal
     <sigmunau@stud.ntnu.no>, activate with --enable-lirc.
   * ./configure.in: put liba52_adec in a builtin for PIC/non-PIC reasons.

2002-02-05 Tuesday 21:46  gbazin

 * New AC3 decoder plugin using liba52 from Aaron Holtzman and
     Michel Lespinasse.
     This plugin isn't used by default, you have to specify:
     --ac3_adec liba52

2002-02-04 Monday 09:58  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: changed module_Need to make it possible to
     have several modules with the same shortcut name.

2002-01-30 Wednesday 23:41  fgp

 *) We now call lockFocus on the QuickDrawView before attempting to get it's qdport.

2002-01-30 Wednesday 00:09  sam

   * Fixed stuff in the wall filter. Extended syntax:
      --filter wall         % open a wall (3x3 is the default value)
      --filter wall:2       % open a 2x2 wall
      --filter wall:3x2     % open a 3x2 wall
      --filter wall:2x1:0   % open a 2x1 wall, only display block 0
      --filter wall:2:0,3   % open a 2x2 wall, only display blocks 0 and 3
     For instance, if you have 2 computers listening to a network stream, on
     the left computer you use --filter wall:2x1:0 and on the right computer
     you use --filter wall:2x1:1

2002-01-29 Tuesday 20:11  gbazin

 * Added mstrtime() to module_symbols_t so we can compile the mpeg_vdec
     plugin with TRACE mode enabled.

2002-01-28 Monday 23:08  stef

 -Fixed ac3_spdif which has been broken recently,

 -Check frequency in ac3_adec and change fifo if needed,

 -Moved initialisation of p_aout from plugins to audio_output.c
 If audio output rate is psecified at launch time, we try to use it by default.

 Note that audio output currently suffers from frequent underruns.
 This has not been fixed here.

2002-01-28 Monday 16:51  sam

   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: MMX YUV to RGB transformation for 15bpp.

2002-01-26 Saturday 01:18  tcastley

 Fixed compliation error due to inclusion of threads.h

2002-01-25 Friday 17:18  sam

   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: we don't use DPMS functions if they are
     not available.

2002-01-25 Friday 06:43  gbazin

 * Added a new very simple audio plugin for Win32. This plugin uses the
     waveOut API which is a lot easier to use for streaming stuff than
     directsound. (you don't have to take care of underflows anymore
     because it doesn't use circular buffers).
     If you are having a lot of underflows, this plugin is currently
     better adapted than the directx plugin.

 * Moved some initialization stuff in audio_out.c so we can now the
     caracteristics of the audio stream before calling aout_Open().

2002-01-24 Thursday 21:54  fgp

 *) Changed configure.in to check for all header files the macosx plugin needs
 *) There is now an option --disable-macosx, instead of --enable-macosx.
    --disable-macosx is default for all plattforms except MACOSX
 *) The mouse cursor is hidden when playing in fullscreen mode
 *) The screensaver is deactivated when playing in fullscreen mode
    (Thanks to Julian Mayer <julianmayer>@mac.com)
 *) Stop, Prev and Next buttons work now.

2002-01-24 Thursday 18:50  stef

 Configure and Makefile tweaking for dvdread module.
 It is now activated with option --with-dvdread, that takes the same options
 as --with-dvdcss.
 If you link with libdvdread statically dvdread is compiled builtin ; if you
 link dynamically, it is compiled as a plugin.

2002-01-24 Thursday 13:32  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: fixed a missing function initialization
     which made decoder plugins segfault in GetChunk calls.
   * ./configure.in: proper soundcard.h check from Yves Duret.

2002-01-23 Wednesday 03:15  stef

 *Merged hh patch in libdvdcss from main tree.

 *Updated local libdvdread, so that it does not depend on libdvdcss
 (ala dummy_dvdcss) and modified configure to reflect changes.

2002-01-21 Monday 23:57  massiot

 * Decoders do not necessarily use bit stream (see mad plug-in)
 * mad PTS should finally be accurate
 * Some configure changes.

2002-01-21 Monday 07:00  gbazin

 * Fixed crashes on exit in the directx plugin
 * vout_PlacePicture is now accepting picture width=height=0

 * Win32 (NT/2000/XP) fix for libdvdcss: first attempt to open the DVD
   device in read/write mode so we can use ioctls. If this fails
   (insufficent privileges) we at least open in read-only mode so the
   libdvdcss title decryption method can be used.

2002-01-21 Monday 05:14  sam

   * ./configure.in: added extra checks for strange compilers such as
     Borland C++ which do not support all gcc options. Note that vlc does
     not compile with bcc32 yet, but is getting closer and closer to.

2002-01-21 Monday 00:52  sam

   * ./plugins/win32: skeleton for the win32 interface Ipkiss is developing.
   * ./config.guess ./config.sub: latest GNU versions.
   * ./configure.in: when possible, xvideo is compiled as a plugin.
   * ./vlc.spec: fixed a few minor inaccuracies.
   * ./debian/control: vlc-gui is no longer depended on, but rather recommended.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: --spumargin flag; use this to force displaying
     subtitles at the bottom of the screen instead of putting them in the
     middle, for instance: `--spumargin 5'.

2002-01-17 Thursday 23:02  gbazin

 * major rewrite of the directx video plugin to adapt it to the new vout4
     architecture. This plugin has also been through a major clean-up
     and it is now much more robust and optimized.

 * Fixed a few problems with the win32 build.

 * Replaced the "overlay" command line option with "nooverlay". The
     former was confusing and useless because overlays were used by
     default anyway.

2002-01-17 Thursday 16:17  sam

   * ./vlc.spec: imported MandrakeSoft's new spec file.
   * ./debian/control: fixed build-dependencies for vlc-mad.

2002-01-16 Wednesday 04:47  sam

   * ./debian/rules: fixed the vlc-arts and vlc-mad package builds.

2002-01-15 Tuesday 19:01  stef

 The gnome/gtk interface should no longer user p_input->stream before it
 has been initialized.

2002-01-15 Tuesday 17:55  stef

 *stream lock is initialized in input_CreateThread instead of initThread,
 to have it initialized when we call it in the interface.

2002-01-15 Tuesday 11:51  asmax

 - added support for S8 and U16 aout (not tested)
 - The sound is very dirty in U8 mode. I don't know if it comes from the
 8 bit mode itself or from the S16->U8 conversion.

2002-01-15 Tuesday 01:01  sam

   * ./debian/control: fixed Debian build-depends.
   * ./include/config.h: changed RELEASE to HAVE_RELEASE because RELEASE
     is already defined in <scsi/scsi.h> under Linux.

2002-01-14 Monday 23:46  massiot

 * More precise way to retrieve a PTS from the bit stream.
 * Fixed issues in the PTS handling of the mad plug-in (incomplete).

2002-01-14 Monday 21:00  jpsaman

 Configure, build and install instructions for libmad library and mad plugin.

2002-01-14 Monday 19:54  asmax

 - le coup de grce: all the code in audio output is now factorized (except
 for ac3 spdif) in aout_common.c/.h
 - aout thread functions are declared with a macro

 TODO:
 - test unsigned 8 bit output, and implement S8 and U16 outputs
 - multi-channel support
 - check if resampling takes the PTS into account (and fix it)

2002-01-14 Monday 12:15  asmax

 HUGE cleanings in audio output:
 - removed AOUT_INTF_*_FIFO, which where not used
 - factorized S16StereoPlay, U8MonoPlay, and so on.., in a single
   function aout_FillBuffer (in aout_common.c)
   (unsigned 8bit may be broken, but I have no stream to test with :(

 - last step to be done: factorize aout_s8, aout_s16, ... thanks to a macro

2002-01-13 Sunday 18:13  gbazin

 * A few fixes for the Win32 build.

2002-01-13 Sunday 15:07  gbazin

 * Fixed all the problems related to ToggleFullScreen().

2002-01-12 Saturday 21:58  jlj

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: Fixed a compile issue under platforms without
     HAVE_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS.

2002-01-12 Saturday 02:02  jlj

   * ./src/interface/intf_eject.c: MacOS X port.

2002-01-12 Saturday 01:25  sam

   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: 24/32 bpp software YUV.
   * ./plugins/ggi/ggi.c: activated double buffering.
   * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: we create more Xv pictures to
     get smoother rendering.

2002-01-11 Friday 03:07  sam

   * BSD compilation fix suggested by Steven M. Schultz.

2002-01-10 Thursday 23:41  asmax

 - beginning of code factorization in aout_s16 (more cleaning will come)
 - As for libmad, I have tried to create the aout fifo in libmad_output,
   to open it with the right sample rate, but strangely it didn't work.

2002-01-10 Thursday 04:11  sam

   * ./src/input/input.c: fixed a few segfaults caused by the dummy plugin.
   * ./plugins/mpeg_adec/mpeg_adec.c: fixed a segfault due to misuse of
     DecoderError.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: replaced XFlush with XSync. This must be the
     fourth time someone has to commit this, so I added a reminder :-)

2002-01-09 Wednesday 10:22  sam

   * ./src/interface/intf_eject.c: BSD/OS port by Steven M. Schultz.

2002-01-09 Wednesday 02:01  sam

   * ./include/modules_inner.h: replaced _X with __VLC_SYMBOL because _X was
     already a system macro under MacOS X.
   * ./plugins/dummy/dummy.c: fixed vlc:loop, vlc:quit, etc. entries.
   * ./plugins/glide/glide.c: activated double buffering.
   * ./plugins/mga/xmga.c: started writing an xmga plugin; doesn't work yet.
   * ./src/input/input.c: fixed the input memory leak, and the insane thread
     spawning we got with vlc:loop.
   * ./src/misc/intf_eject.c: disc ejection routine courtesy of Julien Blache,
     currently Linux-only.

2002-01-09 Wednesday 00:33  asmax

 - better communication between audio decoder and output: aout plugins
 are now opened directly in the right mode (works with mpeg_adec and
 ac3_adec, not tested with mad)
 - first attempt to implement mono output (doesn't work yet)

2002-01-07 Monday 17:02  sam

   ./debian/control: updated list of supported architectures.
   ./share/*: added 16x16 and 32x32 versions of PNG icons.

2002-01-07 Monday 02:12  sam

   * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: removed the mgammx module and put the code in
     the chroma_i420_ymga module instead. This introduces a slight
     performance issue as we now need to memcpy() the Y plane, but I have
     some vout4 enhancements on their way which make this point moot.
   * ./debian/changelog: imported official Debian changelog.
   * ./debian/control: activated the vlc-mad and vlc-arts packages; package
     builds should now work again.
   * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: solved a symbol resolution issue when vlc was
     compiled without libdvdcss which overflowed the return stack.
   * ./plugins/ggi/ggi.c: ported the GGI plugin to vout4.
   * ./plugins/glide/glide.c: ported the Glide plugin to vout4 (untested).
   * ./src/input/input.c: prepared everything for multi-input mode; since
     no interface is yet prepared to handle this, I changed them so that
     they just use the first available input for now. This may break other
     things, but I promise I'll eventually repair everything :-)

2002-01-06 Sunday 17:18  sam

   * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: MMX-accelerated version of the MGA plugin.
   * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/Makefile: Little workaround for PA-Risc compilation.

2002-01-05 Saturday 18:25  sam

   * ./src/audio_output/aout_s16.c: fixed a segfault. It may have unexpected
     side effects because I don't know this part of the code, but at least
     it doesn't crash anymore.
   * ./plugins/beos/beos.cpp: first attempt at porting the BeOS plugin to the
     new video output and module systems. Doesn't work nor even compile yet.
   * ./configure.in: we now check the gtk-config version.

2002-01-05 Saturday 16:09  sam

   * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: we use the MGA_VID_FSEL ioctl to select the
     frame to be displayed. Unfortunately, increasing the number of
     frames doesn't seem to work and makes the picture stutter...

2002-01-05 Saturday 15:17  sam

   * ./Makefile: fixed a bug when no builtins were selected.
   * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: ported the MGA video output to vout4. Only does YV12
     for the moment, and there is a strange bug with some streams which gives
     only a green image. Needs to be looked at.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed a few typos.

2002-01-05 Saturday 03:49  sam

   * ./configure.in: fix for obscure architectures like hppa where target_os
     isn't properly detected.
   * ./include/video_output.h: got rid of pf_setpalette; I'll find a nicer way.
   * ./plugins/mga.c: fixed MGA module compilation. Doesn't work yet, though.

2002-01-05 Saturday 02:22  sam

   * ./include/common.h: hton64 is now an inline function.
   * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c et al.: vout4 now automatically
     detects when two chroma formats are the same, such as UYVY/Y422, or
     roughly equivalent, such as I420/YV12. Plugins need not worry about
     conversion anymore.

2002-01-04 Friday 14:01  sam

   * ./BUGS: added a list of known bugs. Please add your findings!
   * ./MODULES: added a short description of each module. Maybe we should
     add more details to make this file really useful.
   * ./doc/bugreport-howto.txt: wishful thinking...
   * ./Makefile: added a workaround for the fact that .c files don't depend
     on <videolan/vlc.h>.
   * ./plugins/memcpy/memcpy.c: all memcpy modules are now built from the same
     single file.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: added the --nommx, --no3dnow, --nommxext, --nosse
     and --noaltivec options to vlc.
   * ./configure.in: removed the --disable-mmx option, now useless because
     of the vlc --no* options.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: fixed a crash caused by the memcpy module
     being released too early.
   * ./include/video.h: more vout4 changes, including margin support, more
     FOURCC formats recognized, transparent support of identical or almost
     identical FOURCC formats.
   * ./include/video_output.h: added a vout_Render function to video output
     modules which is to be executed before vout_Display.
   * ./include/common.h: this header is back.
   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb.c: planar YUV 4:2:0 to packed RGB conversion
     functions, mostly taken from vout3's yuv functions, but heavily modified
     to use FAST_MEMCPY and to handle image dimensions which are not multiples
     of 16. Not all functions have been written yet, though.
   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_yuy2.c: planar YUV 4:2:0 to packed YUV conversion
     functions, various targets such as 4:2:2 YUYV, YVYU, UYVY, or 2:1:1 YUYV,
     with accelerated MMX versions.
   * ./plugins/chroma/i422_yuy2.c: same as i420_yuy2.c but takes planar YUV
     4:2:2 pictures in input. With accelerated MMX versions as well. This plugin
     makes it possible to display 4:2:2 files on most video cards without the
     quality loss of 4:2:0 downsampling.
   * ./plugins/filter/*: thanks to the vout_Render function, all filters now
     output their data perfectly in sync.
   * ./plugins/dvdread/Makefile: fix to prevent unnecessary target rebuilds.
   * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: support for YV12, UYVY, YUY2 and YVYU overlays.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: support for I420, YV12, YUY2 and Y211 overlays.

2002-01-02 Wednesday 14:37  sam

   * ./ChangeLog: imported the 0.2.92 changes, unrolled current CVS changes.
   * ./include/config.h et al.: this file is no longer generated.
   * ./include/video.h: we use the FOURCC definition of a chroma format to
     describe picture types (see http://www.webartz.com/fourcc/).
   * ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: compilation fix by Eyal Lebedinsky.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed the XShm operations order.

2002-01-01 Tuesday 07:42  sam

   * Last updates for today's release.
