[ Note: this howto is probably useful to core vlc developers only ]

  Release HOWTO
  -------------

 * Have an ECP guy send a mail to ingesys at cti dot ecp dot fr warning them of
   the forecoming traffic (should ideally be done at least a few hours before release) 

 * Tests : compilation, regression tests ...

 * Changes on the svn repository
   - update the version number everywhere it's needed
      configure.ac
      extras/MacOSX/vlc.pbprj/project.pbxproj
      extras/MacOSX/Resources/English.lproj/InfoPlist.string
   - update the ChangeLog and NEWS files, as well as the Trac database
      LANG=C svn log -v -r '{YYYY-12-31}:{YYYY-01-01}' >! ChangeLog
      read all the commits and add important things to the NEWS file
      update the milestones info on https://trac.videolan.org/vlc
   - Add a note about the matching contrib package in INSTALL.win32

 * Commit

 * Tarballs (Use a clean tree !!!)
  - Use 'make distcheck' to make sure all files are exported
    correctly
  - copy the tar.gz and tar.bz2 file on ftp.videolan.org in
    /opt/ftp/pub/videolan/testing/vlc-X.X.X/
  - generate md5 hashes of these files

 * Contribs
  - Put a copy of the libraries or svn snapshot in vlc-X.X.X/contrib
  - Put the relevant win32 contrib package
  - Update developers.v.o/vlc and www.v.o/vlc/download-sources.html

 * BeOS Packages
    Information on building: http://developers.videolan.org/vlc/beos-compile.html
    Build in the "buildbeos" chroot on altair.
    # add the .zip files to /opt/ftp/pub/videolan/testing/vlc-X.X.X/beos/

 * Win32 Packages
    make the packages using the nightly builds configure/options/...
    don't forget to test the installer and uninstaller (the first 0.8.4 uninstaller was broken ...
    kind of suxxs)
    add the .zip and .exe files to /opt/ftp/pub/videolan/testing/vlc-X.X.X/win32/

 * OS X packages
    At the moment, only FK can do them (so they can be compatible with OS X 10.2)
    Later: on the G5

 * Commit changes ... it never works the first time

 * "Tag" the release
    svn cp svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/trunk svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/tag/X.X.X
    or
    svn mv svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/branches/X.X.X svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/tag/X.X.X
