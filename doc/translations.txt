Create translations for VLC media player
==============
The translation files are located in the "po" directory of the vlc sources.
Edit the appropriate file (for instance fr.po for French translation).
Write the translation of "msgid" strings into the "msgstr" field.
You can always ask vlc-devel@videolan.org for assistance.


Writing a new localization
==========================
If there is no localization file for your language, send a mail to
vlc-devel@videolan.org. In return we will send you a localization file,
along with a special VLC binary for your tests.


Testing your localization on UNIX
=================================
You must install the gettext package. See your UNIX distribution, or
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext
Use the convert-po.sh script attached :
  ./convert-po.sh <LANG>.po
Copy the resulting vlc.mo file to
  /usr/local/share/locale/<LANG>/LC_MESSAGES

Launch VLC with --language <LANG>
Where <LANG> is the international shortcode for your language.


Testing your localization on Mac OS X
=====================================
If you do not have GNU gettext installed (you'd probably know if you had
it :), you must download its binaries from our website :
  http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/devtools/gettext-macosx.tar.gz
and extract them into the current directory :
  tar xvzf gettext-macosx.tar.gz

Use the convert-po.sh script attached :
  export PATH=gettext-macosx:$PATH
  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=gettext-macosx
  ./convert-po.sh <LANG>.po
[*]

Copy the resulting vlc.mo file to
  VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/locale/<LANG>/LC_MESSAGES

Launch VLC with --language <LANG>
Where <LANG> is the international shortcode for your language.


"fuzzy" translations
====================
A fuzzy translation is an untranslated string for which gettext did an
automatic suggestion, but needs your confirmation. They are marked with
the "#, fuzzy" comment. If you think the suggestion is OK, or if you
fixed the suggestion, do not forget to remove the "#, fuzzy" comment.


Adding a language to VLC
========================
When the language is added to the VLC sourcecode, remember to also edit
src/libvlc.h for the preference option, and src/misc/darwin_specific.m


[*] Step by step process to localize under Mac OS X (excerpt from a mail) :
cd ~/Desktop
curl -O http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/devtools/vlc-po-files.tar.gz
tar xzf vlc-po-files.tar.gz
cd vlc-po-files
curl -O http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/devtools/gettext-macosx.tar.gz
tar xzf gettext-macosx.tar.gz
export PATH=./gettext-macosx:$PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=./gettext-macosx
[here you copy your it.po file to the vlc-po-files folder on your Desktop]
./convert-po.sh it.po
[here you copy the vlc.mo file to your
VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES]
