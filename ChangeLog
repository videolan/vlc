### THIS CHANGELOG HASN'T BEEN UPDATED FOR UNSTABLE ###

0.1.99j:

  * Added hardware YUV overlay support (SDL). Huge performance
    increase.
  * Minor changes in the Debian files.
  * Fixed fps display.
  * Fixed MPEG1 video decoding. We don't read MPEG 1 PS files for the
    moment.
  * Fixed a 100% cpu usage bug, in the dummy aout.
  * Added a 'f' shortcut to switch between Windowed and Fullscreen
    mode.
  * Added --broadcast option for network input.
  * Screen is now emptied when framebuffer output exits.
  * Totally new frame dropping algorithm.
  * Fixed a bug in video_ouput.c which trashed more late pictures than
    necessary.
  * Fixed the DEBUG mode in the Makefile.
  * Fixed a bug in mwait() which made us wait too long.
  * The video_decoder can now be split into several threads to take
    advantage of the SMP machines.
  * Added --enable-debug, --enable-stats, and --disable-optims in the
    GNU configure stuff.
  * Added alsa audio support (plugin)  
  * vlc is now compiled without the STATS mode by default.
  * Fixed a bug which made frames go backwards with some displays (the
    video_decoder thread is now niced).
  * Added intf_WarnMsg(), and made use of it in the most needed places.

0.1.99i :

  * fixed the support for field pictures, which involved a few dozens
    bugs in the video parser and video decoder.
  * put names of authors under a lot of source files, for historical
    purposes.
  * fixed another input_file exit bug for the beos version.
  * fixed the aliases install.
  * renamed an inconsistent variable in src/input/input_file.c.
  * added support for I+ synchro (all Is and the first P).
  * fixed a motion compensation bug which generated some distortion
    on B images.
  * fixed a motion compensation bug for skipped macroblocks.
  * fixed a synchro bug for field images.
  * cleaned Octplane's crappy indentation.
  * fixed the --server option which didn't work if a ~/.vlcrc existed.

0.1.99h :

  * fixed the sound issue under beos.
  * fixed a bug that was making the crash randomly under beos.
  * fixed a bug that was exhausting system ressources under beos.
  * improved the cond_var for beos.
  * added support for the SDL vout : the --display fullscreen allows 
    fullscreen when possible. Disabled by default.
  * added sdlvlc (which probably should start in fullscreen, no ?)
  * removed sdlvlc :)
  * updated debian directory to build vlc-sdl.
  * removed CCFLAGS flags which were improperly used.
  * added hints for powerpc build.
  * fixed the input_file exit bug.
  * fixed a Makefile bug which removed the CVS directory.
  * removed the frame statistics output.
  * removed a verbose message in intf_sdl.c.
  * added a few sanity checks in the audio mpeg and ac3 decoders.
  * temporarily got rid of vlc.channels.
  * added notice in debian/control about unencrypted DVDs.
  * fixed PowerPC .deb build.

0.1.99g :

  * removed all "*vlc" aliases except "gvlc" and "fbvlc". The other sucked.
  * new --synchro flag which lets you force which images are decoded.
  * removed an unused variable in the MMX YUVs.
  * fixed 32bpp MMX YUV, made the comments clearer, removed an emms.
  * now scaling is on by default, so that people won't tell that the vlc
    cannot do scaling :-)
  * fixed a few long lines.
  * fixed 8bpp YUV.
  * fixed the fscked up Bresenham algorithm in all YUV functions.
  * fixed a dumb bug in the Makefile that prevented inclusion of the
    -march=pentium directive. thanks Meuuh, blame sam.
  * fixed a warning in main.c.
  * separate Debian packages.
  * added request for ALSA support in the TODO list.
  * changed "pentiumpro" to "ppro" in the ./configure, it was misleading.
