   do the actual execution of this command. this is a (very ugly) workaround
   to the problem we were having with the deinterlace menu on osx.

   It works now, but now i'm running into the black screen and continous
   "late picture skipped (-218000)" again which is also plagueing us when you
   enter fullscreen with a filter enabled. This ought to be fixed before 0.6.0
   as well.

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: fixed bug in sout dialog box.
 * modules/gui/skins/*: factorised the wxwindows dialogs code in dialogs.cpp. wxWindows is also initialised earlier on to allow opening a skins file with a wxWin dialog box. (Note: I badly broke the GTK2 skins).

 Note: There are still a few bugs in the code handling the controls and
 their different states, and I think they will be difficult to fix with
 the current code structure. A rewrite of this part of code could be a
 good idea (perhaps using states and transitions between states, like
 Zinf does?).

  * src/input/input_ext-intf.c :  added an input_SetRate function; it is
    quite more convenient than, e.g, calling input_SetStatus( STATUS_FASTER )
    two times if you want to switch from 1:1 to 4:1 from the interface.
    Old functions still work.

  * mjpeg grabbing added, thanks to Paul Forgey <paulf at aphrodite dot com>
  that had done all the work.

 Paul Forgey's notes:
 --------------------

 Unfortunatley, the v4l interface shows how much it sucks here.  I can't
 wait for v4l2 to become more common.  Anyway, the mjpeg mechanism
 captures completely differently than the uncompressed frame capture
 mechanism.  This means the code has to split off a bunch to do similar
 things depending on mjpeg being set or not.  For some reason, I can't
 use non v4l2 calls to capture uncompressed frames from the lml33,
 however I do have another bttv card on my system to test that I didn't
 break the non-mjpeg stuff.

 The Zoran encoders don't use square pixels.  So the 4:3 (or 16:9)
 picture is going to show up as 720x480.  I don't know my way around the
 code well enough to know how to specify a non-square pixel aspect
 ratio.  If there isn't a way to do it, it would be nice to be able to
 specify as an option the aspect ratio of the sourc.  Either 4:3 or 16:9
 in the case of anamorphic S-Video, which does occur.

 I stole the videodev_mjpeg.h header from the lavrec project.  Despite
 the linux kernels having support for the Zoran cards, there doesn't seem
 to be a reliable way to pick up this header, which is probably why
 lavrec did it this way.  Since it only defines ioctl definitions, I
 don't think using it is a legal problem.

 I also modified the audio handling a bit.  If the card supports audio,
 great, we'll set the card's parameters as we did before.  But if adev=
 is specified, use it regardless.  The reason to do this is to capture
 audio from the sound card with video coming from, say, a web cam or in
 my case, an encoder card which doesn't have any audio capabilities at
 all.

2003-05-12 Monday 01:17  hartman

 * First set config variable, then add the files (and therefore potentially

2003-05-07 Wednesday 15:44  fenrir

  * ffmpeg: --ffmpeg-truncated is now an int :

   * 0  -> disable CODEC_FLAG_TRUNCATED
   * 1  -> force CODEC_FLAG_TRUNCATED

 any misdetection. (Even when there is a spec, nobody follows it :((

2003-05-07 Wednesday 00:28  fenrir

   the VLCWindow could suddenly disappear (the vout closed) and therefore we

   more generic to avoid code duplication.

2003-05-06 Tuesday 16:05  fenrir

  * mp4: fix a segfault and play .3gp with h263 video track.

2003-05-06 Tuesday 14:19  fenrir

  * all: new sout scheme. Now a chain of module are created that can
 modify/apply on all streams, --sout has the same behavour expect when
 starting with a '#'.

  With a starting '#' you can specify a chain of modules, it's still
 unstable but a lot more powerfull.
  You have access to duplicate(that duplicate all stream), transcode
 (using only ffmpeg), standard/std and es (that apply muxers and access),
 and display. You could chain them with ':' and specify options with
 {option1=value,option2=value[,...]}.

 ex: * to stream and see the stream to udp/ts:ip
  --sout '#duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,url=ip}}'
     * to transcode,see and stream
  --sout '#transcode{acodec=mpga}:duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,url=ip}}'

  Without a starting '#', the url is converted into '#std{acces=,mux=,url}'
 Test and report bugs :)

2003-03-25 Tuesday 17:07  gbazin

 * src/input/input.c, src/video_output/video_output.c: when the input thread
    ends, it will also destroy the vout if one was spawned.

2003-03-25 Tuesday 15:38  gbazin

 * src/misc/modules.c: module_Need() now only raises the scores of the
    plugins matching the given shortcuts list, unless "none" is closing the
    list (in which case only the plugins matching the list can be selected).

    Which means that users will stop complaining vlc doesn't launch anymore
    or can't play anything after they have fiddled with their config
    options :))

2003-03-25 Tuesday 00:43  gbazin

 * src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed my previous commit (input is not a direct parent of vout).

2003-03-24 Monday 23:50  gbazin

 * modules/access/ftp.c, modules/access/http.c: the http and ftp plugins now implement SetProgram(). TS streams will now work over

 * modules/access/*: don't forget to reinitialize the timeout when looping around select().

2003-03-24 Monday 17:15  gbazin

 * modules/access/*: pf_read() in access modules is now blocking. We still
    check regularly for p_input->b_die though. Now the demuxers can safely
    assume that pf_read() == 0 means EOF.
 * ALL: got rid of the p_input->b_connected flag.
 * src/input/input_ext-plugins.c, src/input/input.c: fixed the infinite loop
    of "decoder stuck" messages that sometimes happened.
 * src/interface/intf_eject.c, modules/misc/network/ipv4.c: fixed compilation
    warnings.

2003-03-24 Monday 15:20  hartman

 * modules/access/directory.c: fixed the directory access plugin.
 * configure.ac.in, modules/access/Modules.am: enabled the directory access plugin.

2003-03-24 Monday 00:12  hartman

 * a new directory access module. It parses a directory with dirent and builds
   a m3u 'file' which it feeds to the m3u demuxer.
   Problems: - it requires a dir to end with /
             - if i enabled it, all files would use the m3u demuxer for some
             strange reason. i've spent a day hunting this down, reboot-
             strapping and doing who knows what. I'm sick of it now.
             Someone else can give it a try, if he wants to.

   Now a complete redesign of the hiding of the mousecursor.
   - We use higher level functions now (NSCursor).
   - We only hide if the cursor is over our VLCView
   - In many exceptions we unhide. This is mainly for multimonitor support.

2003-03-18 Tuesday 21:34  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, m4/*, po/Makefile.in.in: build updated to use gettext 0.11.5 by default.

 * modules/gui/macosx/vout.m:
   Reworked the mouse hiding routine. we were always hiding the mousecursor
   on kCGDirectMainDisplay, but this display is always the one with the
   menubar and not always the one containing our VLCVout.
   This new code takes the vout, and calculates on which displays (plural
   because of possible mirroring) it is being shown. It then shows or hides
   the cursor on all of those displays.
   This should fix #396.

 * added fourcc '3ivd' to .avi, .mov and ffmpeg.
   - this is video which was divx doctored by the 3ivx doctor program.
   - it is normal DIV3 video and ffmpeg decodes it via MPEG4 v3.

 * added fourcc '3vid' to .avi, .mov and ffmpeg.
   - this is incorrect encoded DIV3. it is an endianness issue by the encoder.
   - ffmpeg can decode it however, so it is mapped to MPEG4 v3.

 automatically discarding audio samples that were above AOUT_MAX_ADVANCE_TIME

2003-02-20 Thursday 01:52  sigmunau

 * include/configuration.h: added a new flag to the configuration stucture to
 indicate wether it is an "advanced" option or not. The goal with this is to
 hide the user from all the strange options that very seldom needs to be
 changed. added an extra argument to all the add_* macros to indicate wether
 the item is advanced or not.
 * src/libvlc.h: added an "show advanced options" config option default
 disabled
 * src/libvlc.c: the advanced options are not listed by vlc --help and
 friends unless --advanced is used
 * modules/gtk/preferences.c: the gtk/gnome preferences dialog don't show
 advanced options unless advanced is set
 all: set the advanced flag to VLC_FALSE or VLC_TRUE for all options, by
 using some common sense. Please check and correct

 note: All interfaces should still work like they used to, see the change in
 modules/gtk/preferences.c to find out how to "hide" options.

 second note: I think I've changed all the modules, but I could not test
 everyone for compilation, expect some broken modules (the fix is to add ",
 VLC_TRUE" as last argument to the add_* I forgot)

 modules/gui/beos/InterfaceWindow.h/.cpp

 	- updated vlc way of saving settings to be on par with BeOS way
 		and made it selectable in the code which way is used.
 		However, the VideoSettings are still only savable in
 		the BeOS way.

 	- if dvd menus are used, the navigation menu enables a
 		"Goto Menu" item. Unfortunately, I don't see a clean
 		way to really detect the usage of dvd/dvdold in the
 		currently playing stream. I wouldn't want to see
 		if a playlist item has "dvd:" or "dvdold:" prepended
 		at each interface update.

 * modules/codec/spudec/spudec.c, modules/codec/spudec/text.c: fixed the
    race condition between spudec and vout. This patch may not be all that

    solution I've been able to come-up with.
    Oh and I didn't fix the memory leak caused by the font when using text
    subtitles. If the vout changes while the spudec is running then we don't
    unload this font.

 decoder_fifo_t (p_waveformatex and p_bitmapinfoheader). It's
 a replacement of p_demux_data as this variable is used by
 some demuxers in another way. This way, I will be able to add

     it's not done in an obscure "if" statement.

     know what's going on.

2002-12-27 Friday 12:44  sam

 check the file extension (.dv). You can additionaly force this demuxer.

 PS: the ffmpeg plugin works quite well for decoding dv videos.

2002-12-15 Sunday 20:48  jpsaman

 Fix crash on directory change.

2002-12-15 Sunday 18:37  ipkiss

  * ./modules/gui/wxwindows: added a log window

2002-12-15 Sunday 16:28  gbazin

 * include/vlc/vlc.h: added a new pi_types field to vlc_list_t. This field will be used
 later on by the object variables functions. I'm adding it now because it also happens to
 solve a binary compatibility problem between gcc and bcc. (depending on compilers,
 structs of 32 < size <= 64 bits can be returned either in a register or in the stack).

2002-12-14 Saturday 23:17  jpsaman

 Fix for building Familiar interface with libgpewidget0 library.

2002-12-14 Saturday 22:33  fenrir

  * libvlc.h: Fix mux/access_output options.

2002-12-14 Saturday 21:32  fenrir

  Added stream output. (common work with titer).

2002-12-14 Saturday 19:43  gbazin

 * src/libvlc.c: oops, forgot to remove a debug message.

2002-12-14 Saturday 19:34  gbazin

 * src/misc/objects.c: implemented the FIND_CHILD mode for vlc_list_find().
    vlc_object_get() now increments the refcount of the object so you'll need to release
 the object at some point.
 * src/misc/variables.c, ALL: var_Change() with VLC_VAR_GETLIST now returns a vlc_value_t
 which points to a vlc_list_t.

2002-12-14 Saturday 19:19  gbazin

 * src/misc/threads.c: implemented vlc_thread_set_priority() for win32.

2002-12-14 Saturday 18:57  fenrir

  * all: with mpeg4 video I changed the way that some initialisation data
 are passed (more logical).

2002-12-14 Saturday 01:05  babal

 - support for Windows style file names for relative paths
 - when eol_tok is '\n', use last line even if eol_tok isn't present

2002-12-13 Friday 22:11  yves

 adaptation for 0.5 branch. almost working :)

2002-12-13 Friday 17:05  babal

 - * : start playing only when opening a stream from the main window;
   when opening it from the playlist window, add it to the list, but
   don't change anything to the playing state and current stream.

 - playlist.dfm : proper resizing behaviour

2002-12-13 Friday 16:26  babal

 - vlc_playlist.h, playlist.c: added the ability to save a playlist to
   and restore it from a file chosen by the user.

 - win32/*:

   - implementation of the previous feature in the win32 interface
 >   -> what the other interfaces need to do to support it is simply to
 >      call the two following functions:
 >       int playlist_LoadFile(playlist_t *p_playlist,const char *psz_filename);
 >       int playlist_SaveFile(playlist_t *p_playlist,const char *psz_filename);
 >      where psz_filename is the name of the destination/source file.

   - ability to open several files at a time

2002-12-13 Friday 10:09  sam

   * ./Makefile.am: added missing files for make dist.
   * ./configure.ac.in: removed unpopular warnings.
   * ./po/*: updated potfiles.

2002-12-13 Friday 03:52  videolan

  * ./modules/win32/menu.cpp: reorganized the code for menus generation,
    and got rid of the global variable (at last!) in the win32 interface.

 Please check that navigation and language selection aren't too much
 broken for DVDs...

2002-12-13 Friday 01:56  gbazin

 * ALL: added a new vlc_list_t common type. vlc_list_find() and vlc_list_release() have been modified
 to use this new type.

2002-12-13 Friday 01:50  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: added skeleton for popup contextual menu.
 * modules/access/dvdplay/access.c, modules/audio_filter/resampler/linear.c: a couple of warning
 fixes.

2002-12-12 Thursday 15:23  gbazin

 * src/input/input.c: forgot to commit this during my last commit :p

2002-12-12 Thursday 15:10  gbazin

 * src/input/input_clock.c, include/input_ext-intf.h: introduced an i_pts_delay field in
 input_thread_t (initialised to DEFAULT_PTS_DELAY).
 * modules/access/*: i_pts_delay is now configurable on an access module basis. The pts
 delay for http and mms have been raised to 4 * DEFAULT_PTS_DELAY, which is about 1.2
 seconds worth of caching.

2002-12-12 Thursday 13:09  sam

   * ./debian/vlc-plugin-ogg.dirs: added a missing file for Debian package
     builds.

2002-12-12 Thursday 12:24  sam

   * ./modules/gui/familiar/*: compilation fixes. Crashes on directory change.

2002-12-12 Thursday 11:37  ipkiss

    (thanks Garf)

2002-12-12 Thursday 11:29  massiot

2002-12-11 Wednesday 21:50  jpsaman

 Fixed qte video output segmentation fault during initialization.
 The following things have still to be fixed:
 - segmentation fault on destroy
 - video placing and
 - orientation
 - video line spacing is wrong

2002-12-11 Wednesday 20:13  fenrir

  * all: access plugins should not modify
 p_input->stream.p_selected_area->i_tell when reading data. (It's done in
 input_SplitBuffer). (But access should still set it on a "seek")

2002-12-11 Wednesday 17:27  bozo

 New ALSA audio output. It works with ALSA 0.9.0rc4 and earlier versions.

2002-12-10 Tuesday 23:34  gbazin

 * modules/demux/wav/wav.c: small bug-fix for screwed pts calculation.

2002-12-10 Tuesday 21:55  gbazin

 * src/audio_output/filters.c: fix for resampler buffer size.

2002-12-10 Tuesday 18:22  gbazin

 * ALL: fixed a f*ckage I introduced recently ;) var_Type() now returns 0 when the variable
 doesn't exist, but the rest of the code wasn't updated according to this new behaviour.
 * modules/audio_output/waveout.c: changed a few error messages into warning messages.

2002-12-10 Tuesday 15:51  ipkiss

  * ./modules/gui/win32: deletd a dependancy with a global variable

2002-12-10 Tuesday 14:19  gbazin

 * include/configuration.h: fixed my previous fix.

2002-12-10 Tuesday 12:46  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: fixed ugly hack in sdl detection code (which also broke my build :p)
 * include/configuration.h, include/modules_inner.h: proper fix for a bug that allowed gcc
 to put things in the stack instead of the data segment.

2002-12-10 Tuesday 10:22  fenrir

  ffmpeg: adapted to current cvs version. It should still compile with older
 one (Please reports if it doesn't).

2002-12-10 Tuesday 00:02  gitan

 fixed a segfault under windows.

2002-12-09 Monday 23:37  gbazin

 * include/configuration.h: rolled back the last changes made to this file. There is no
 sense in manually initializing all the fields of module_config_t as it will be done by the
 compiler anyway. Furthermore mingw32 gcc seems to have problems optimizing code
 that manually initializes structures to 0.

2002-12-09 Monday 21:37  jpsaman

 Syncing functionality with vlc-0.4.6

2002-12-09 Monday 21:36  jpsaman

 Fixed segfault in Qt Embedded Video Output.

2002-12-09 Monday 13:37  titer

  * AudioOutput.cpp: added sanity tests;
  * VlcWrapper.h, Interface.cpp: removed an unused variable.

2002-12-09 Monday 07:57  titer

  * AudioOutput.cpp: send zeros to BSoundPlayer if nothing comes from
     audio output;
  * VlcWrapper.cpp: handle volume using aout3 features.

2002-12-09 Monday 03:36  titer

  Default re-enabled dvd module.
   --disable-dvd works anyway.

2002-12-09 Monday 00:52  babal

 - new headphone channel mixer with virtual spatialization effect : This
   effect should give you the feeling that you stands in a real room with
   a complete 5.1 speaker set when using only a headphone, providing a
   more realistic sound experience. It should also be more comfortable
   and less tiring when listening to music for long periods of time.It
   works with any source format from mono to 5.1.

   -> please try it and feel free to give me some feedback. Some
      improvements are already planned (adding echo, more configuration
      options, ...).

 NB: whereas the filter itself is in a (very first) stable version, the
     way it is integrated to the filter chain is only a _temporary_ hack
     since it's the audio ouput core (input.c actually) which is directly
     responsible for it. Integrating it in a more suitable way will
     probably require some work on the way the filters are selected as
     well as on the configuration level, but I'm working on it :)

2002-12-08 Sunday 23:38  massiot

 * Updated aout3 developer doc.
 * Reworked the Open... menu items, and added the ability to use libdvdplay.
 * Sound output menu is now under Controls.

2002-12-08 Sunday 21:05  jpsaman

 Fixed build and linking for qte video output and made modifications to iPaq packaging files.

2002-12-08 Sunday 19:56  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: compilation fixes for wxX11 (it doesn't support drag and drop
 yet). Compilation fix for MacOSX as well (wxEntry() not declared).
 * src/misc/variables.c: added a FreeMutex() function.

2002-12-08 Sunday 16:16  jpsaman

 - Updated Maintainers file
 - fixed --disable-dvd, it did not work
 - updated iPaq familiar buildscripts

2002-12-08 Sunday 14:47  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: fix for dvdread and libdvdplay plugins linking stage.

2002-12-08 Sunday 05:30  jlj

   * ALL: Under Jaguar, vout no longer depends on any specific MacOS X
          intf. wxWindows should work (not tested). Closes #33.

2002-12-08 Sunday 00:41  massiot

 New vlc_thread_set_priority function, to set the priority of the main
 thread.

2002-12-07 Saturday 23:50  massiot

 * configure.ac.in: Disabled -Wtraditional as it produces much more bogus
   warnings than real ones.
 * audio output: New intf-change variable to know when audio-channels
   and audio-device have changed.
 * video output: New intf-change variable and vout_VarCallback, to know
   when video-device has changed (OS X port).
 * modules/gui/macosx/*: Menus for audio channels, implemented volume
   management, added a menu for screen selection.

2002-12-07 Saturday 22:29  titer

  * default disabled SAP under BeOS

2002-12-07 Saturday 22:15  gitan

  * use RGB32 BBitmap. That fixes the bad-looking picture in
    non-overlay mode (thanks Sam).

2002-12-07 Saturday 15:25  gbazin

 * ALL: a few updates to the variables API:
   - got rid of the VLC_VAR_COMMAND variable type and introduced the VLC_VAR_ISCOMMAND flag
 instead. This simplifies things and avoid the strange command variables behaviour. Command
 variables will now trigger their callback on var_Set() like any other variables (look in
 modules/control/rc/rc.c for an example).
   - Renamed the VLC_VAR_ISLIST flag into VLC_VAR_HASCHOICE.
   - Added a new VLC_VAR_VOID variable type. This can be useful in conjunction with
 VLC_VAR_ISCOMMAND for instance.

2002-12-06 Friday 22:44  gitan

 * sap.c : make it more compliant (as far as sdp is involved).
 * playlist.c : fixed a memory leak
 * configure.ac.in : added link flags

2002-12-06 Friday 21:27  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: fixed typo. For dvdread support we have to check for
  dvdread/dvd_reader.h, not dvdread/dvdread.h.

2002-12-06 Friday 16:34  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: removed -W in favour of -Wtraditional.
   * ALL: a bunch of additional warning fixes.

2002-12-06 Friday 14:22  fenrir

  all: fix some minors warnings.

2002-12-06 Friday 13:05  sam

   * ./modules/access/mms/mms.c: fixed signed/unsigned comparisons, and fixed
     a bug I found in Read(). No idea whether it was triggered before nor what
     it was doing, though :)

2002-12-06 Friday 12:54  sam

   * ./modules/access/http.c: code clean-up. removed sizeof()-1 calls where we
     meant strlen(), removed useless strcmp() calls, implemented atoll() for
     systems where it does not exist, fixed a memory leak, fixed a minor data
     corruption.

2002-12-06 Friday 12:18  sigmunau

 some support for redirection. Moved the break on returncode >=400 to after
 the header parsing. This will be usefull if anyone wants to implemet
 http-passwd support

2002-12-06 Friday 11:53  fenrir

  * ffmpeg: sync with latest ffmpeg cvs. As it need too much
 #if LIBAVCODEC_BUILD , I've enable direct rendering only with latest
 ffmpeg cvs (anyway dr isn't cleanly ported to the latest version).

2002-12-06 Friday 10:10  sam

   * ./src/*, ./include/*: fixed a bunch of badly initialized structures, a few
     signed/unsigned comparisons, and removed trailing spaces here and there.

2002-12-06 Friday 06:42  babal

  * src/playlist/playlist.c : playing again a playlist already in a
    playing state resets the input speed to normal to make sure the
    stream isn't paused or slowed or played faster anymore.
    By doing that, fixes the following bug of the Windows interface:
    when pushing the play button on a paused or slowed stream, nothing
    used to happen.
  * modules/gui/win32/playlist.cpp : when pushing the play button and the
    playlist is empty, displaying the playlist window
  * win32.cpp : rephrasing the module description to "Native Windows
    interface module"

2002-12-05 Thursday 21:49  jpsaman

 Fix for SDL-1.2.5 it now has SDL postpended to the library path. I just rip it of now for --cflags.

2002-12-05 Thursday 17:38  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: disabled -Wconversion for gcc 2.x because it makes it
     choke on system headers.

2002-12-05 Thursday 17:16  sam

   * ./ipkg/Makefile.in: removed a file handled by automake.
   * ./configure.ac.in: additional warning flags for GCC.
        -Wconversion
            Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from
            what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a proto-
            type.
        -Wsign-compare
            Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could
            produce an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to
            unsigned.
        -Wunreachable-code
            Warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed.
        -Wdisabled-optimization
            Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.
     See the gcc documentation for more explanations. This triggers a lot of
     warnings everywhere, and at first sight they're all worth fixing. Code
     quality matters, too, so let's fix'em :)

2002-12-04 Wednesday 21:48  gbazin

 * modules/audio_filter/channel_mixer/trivial.c: bugfix for up-mixing.

2002-12-04 Wednesday 21:03  jpsaman

 Build and packaging files for Opie and GPE.

  * configure.ac.in, mms.c, sap.c, ipv4.c: added network support for BeOS 5
    (Dano is no more needed); multicast still doesn't work.
    UDP (unicast) and HTTP have been successfully tested, mms is untested.
  * sap.c: BeOS doesn't have memccpy

 playlist_item_t instead of psz_target ). Now playlist_Add uses
 playlist_AddItem to enqueue.
 * include/vlc_playlist.h : Added a psz_uri field in the playlist_item_t
 structure.
 * src/input/input.c : takes item->psz_uri  argument to start playing an
 item.

  * adpcm.c: add adpcm decoding support (Now just ms and ima adpcm from
 microfsoft, not yet ima4)
  * wav, asf, avi: fix fourcc creation for adpcm. (Nevertheless adpcm
 could not work with asf because of asf audio scrambling unsupported in asf
 demuxer). Seek will not work, because vlc send garbage and then break stream
 alignment.(I will try to fix that).

2002-12-03 Tuesday 16:29  gitan

 * Added a session announcement protol module (enabled by default).
 * Added the PLAYLIST_CHECK_INSERT option to the playlist. That option
 checks previously enqueued sessions before enqueing.

2002-12-03 Tuesday 12:59  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.h: fixed an aspect ratio bug, we should default to the

 big endian architectures ? (else could you give vlc log )

2002-11-28 Thursday 15:18  sigmunau

 * set b_seakable to false for http/1.0 streams such as those from icecast.
 * allow some unusual, but legal ways to construct the http headers, and
 clean up the header parsing code. parsing other headers ( like the mime-type
 ) should be very easy now.

2002-11-28 Thursday 14:34  sam

   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: added a --aspect-ratio option to force
     the aspect ratio of the stream. Two different usages are possible, either
     int:int ("16:9") to specify a real aspect ratio, or float ("1.25") to
     specify pixel squareness.

     Note that it does not work properly yet; it will need an API change in
     the video output layer that I'm working on.

 - Enterely new layout for the preference window of the native win32
   interface, in order to improve its clarity (the dialog box is now even
   a bit smaller) and to get closer to Windows standards.
   (second part of the job, and hopefully the last for now, begun with
   Ipkiss a few days ago by using CheckListBoxes)

   Still need some work to get the interface compatible with Windows XP
   skins.

   * ./modules/video_chroma/i420_rgb16.c: merged the RV15 and RV16 conversions

 Reduced number of false positives for both html and asx files. We now also

 autogenerated on the webserver using php or asp.

    contrast, hue and saturation are adjustable)

2002-11-23 Saturday 14:28  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: misc improvements to the main interface, implementation of
 drag and drop, proper initialisation of the i18n routines.

2002-11-23 Saturday 04:40  sam

   * ./modules/access/http.c, ./modules/misc/network/ipv4.c: http and ipv4
     plugins compile for WinCE. Couldn't test yet though.

2002-11-23 Saturday 02:40  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/wingdi.c: the GDI video output now properly sets
     the bitmasks; we're not limited to 8bpp and 16/24 works.
   * ./modules/video_filter/*: the video filters now work under WinCE.

2002-11-23 Saturday 01:32  ipkiss

  * ./modules/gui/wxwindows/playlist.cpp: added a playlist to the wxwindows interface

  * yuv filter was a bit useless. Hope adjust filter is more usefull :)

2002-11-22 Friday 23:12  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: we only add -lm to the a52 linkage if it's needed
     (and available).

2002-11-22 Friday 20:27  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/wingdi.c: ported the wingdi plugin to Win32; it
     somewhat works under Wine (if you force internal buffers to 8bpp), but
     doesn't work under Win2k. Any hints welcome.
   * ./configure.ac.in: activated the wingdi plugin by default.

2002-11-22 Friday 19:37  titer

  * AudioOutput.cpp : compilation fix.
  * VideoOutput.cpp : now --fullscreen works with BeOS video output.

2002-11-22 Friday 18:35  sam

   * ./modules/access/mms/var_buffer.h: this file is now a separate .c, to
     prevent gcc's optimizer to go amok with nested inline functions, loop
     unrolling and such things that we don't really need in an access plugin.

2002-11-22 Friday 15:24  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/directx/events.c: we now call CreateWindow so that
     we are sure that the WndProc always has a valid p_vout value.

2002-11-22 Friday 15:19  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/wingdi.c: implemented offscreen rendering with
     fast blit (well at least it was considered "fast" back in the times of
     Windows 3.1). Default is 8bpp because that's what my iPaq does (no
     palette support yet though), 16bpp can be chosen at compile time and
     works perfectly in the emulator.

2002-11-22 Friday 12:11  sam

   * ./modules/video_chroma/i420_rgb16.c: fixed a segfault in the 24/32bpp

    This module allows decoding vorbis audio on hardware without a fpu
    (--enable-tremor).

 * modules/LIST: added entries for tremor and theora.

2002-11-21 Thursday 13:53  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/wingdi.c: skeleton of a Windows GDI video output.
   * ./modules/access/file.c: the file access plugin gets the real file size
     under WinCE.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/u8tofixed32.c: added this conversion
     filter to play some WAV files without an FPU.
   * ./bootstrap: bootstrap --update-vc doesn't rely on the Makefile's presence.

2002-11-21 Thursday 10:12  gbazin

   * ./src/misc/messages.c: added ^Ms to the WinCE logfile.
   * ./bootstrap: fixed a typo that prevented per-object target directories
     to work.
   * ./evc/*, ./msvc/*: removed project files; they're becoming a bit large
     (more than 1MB) and I don't want to spoil the CVS with them.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 17:23  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: temporary hack for libdvbpsi detection.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 16:43  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/waveout.c: audio output now works under WinCE
     using the waveout module.
   * ./bootstrap: we ignore comments when parsing makefiles.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/fixed32tofloat32.c: changed this module
     so that it also does float32tofixed32.
   * ./modules/*: ported a few other modules to WinCE (most of the time it's
     just a #include <errno.h> that needs to be removed).

2002-11-20 Wednesday 15:58  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/gui/wxwindows/wxwindows.cpp: other compilation
    fixes for the wxwindows interface on win32.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 15:34  gbazin

 * modules/control/rc/rc.c: added commands to navigate between chapters and
    titles.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 14:24  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: fixes for the win32 build. Removed a few
    unnecessary things and replaced the stop icon with a new one.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 14:09  gbazin

 * modules/codec/theora.c, configure.ac.in, modules/codec/Modules.am: new
    theora codec plugin.
    This plugin is based on the experimental theora codec from the Xiph.Org
    foundation (http://www.theora.org/). Because the theora bitstream
    specifications are likely to change in the near future, this plugin won't
    be compiled by default. If you want to test/develop theora with vlc, you'll
    need to configure it with --enable-theora and also make sure you've got a
    fresh libogg from cvs.

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: modified to handle theora and tarkin bitstreams.

 * modules/codec/tarkin.c: fixed a few typos.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 13:37  sam

   * ./evc/plugins.vcp.in: fixed plugin entry points for WinCE.
   * ./modules/*: fixed a bunch of modules so that they compile under WinCE,
     we now have access_file and the mpeg demux and video decoder working
     (http://zoy.org/~sam/vlc/pocketvlc2.png).

2002-11-20 Wednesday 08:58  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h, ./src/extras/libc.c: exported our custom libc
     functions to plugins.
   * ./bootstrap: enhanced the project file generation for plugins; we now
     parse makefiles to make this easier.
   * ./modules/**/Modules.am: reworked a few makefiles so that they are more
     easily parsed.

2002-11-20 Wednesday 01:47  gbazin

 * src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a really old bug in the video output
    layer. This bug was only affecting video outputs without direct rendering
    capabilities.

2002-11-19 Tuesday 20:56  gbazin

 * modules/misc/network/ipv6.c: restored the msg_*() outputs from BuildAddr().

2002-11-19 Tuesday 20:45  gbazin

 * include/video.h, include/vlc_config.h, src/video_output/*: changed the
    picture buffer allocation scheme to allocate pictures from the render
    heap in a clockwise fashion instead of always picking the first available
    one from the start of the heap.
    This allows us to benefit from ffmpeg's macro-block skipping feature.
    As a side effect, we also have less chance of reusing a refrence picture
    buffer when we can't link/unlink them.

 * modules/codec/ffmpeg/video.c: modified the direct rendering code to benefit
    from the macro-block skipping algorithm.
    A new flag has also been introduced in the video_output's render heap to
    forbid modifications to the render picture buffers (for instance to overlay
    subtitles).

2002-11-19 Tuesday 17:38  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: p_module->psz_filename is now filled with a real
     8 bit string under WinCE.
   * ./extras/Win32_msvc: scrapped this directory.
   * ./bootstrap: we now parse plugin makefiles to guess what to put in
     the MSVC project files. Only the dummy plugin has been tested yet.

   * ./modules/misc/dummy/*: hacked the dummy plugin so that it compiles for
     WinCE.

2002-11-18 Monday 13:28  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/codec/Modules.am, modules/codec/tarkin.c: added
    an experimental tarkin video decoder. You will need to specify the tarkin
    tree you want to use with --with-tarkin-tree=.

    Warning: Tarkin is still in very early development stage, so this plugin isn't
    actually usefull unless you intend to do some development on tarkin itself.

2002-11-18 Monday 13:08  gbazin

 * modules/demux/m3u.c: should manage entries with relative paths.
 * src/playlist/playlist.c: fixed playlist_Next().

2002-11-18 Monday 13:02  gbazin

 * added a wxwindows interface using the wxWindows cross-platform GUI framework.
    The interface is quite basic for now but should be functional anyway.
    (you need to have wxWindows >= 2.3.0 installed to use this plugin)

2002-11-18 Monday 11:50  sam

   * ./bootstrap: reverted the behaviour behaviour to the default, which
     means no default flag to use (except for me, muahaha).

  * mp4: fix a bug in timestamp calculation. Replace s/u* by s/uint*_t
  * avi : remove an useless debug message.
  * src/misc/objects.c : fix stream output object allocation.

 MicroDVD, SubRIP, SSA subtitle format should work...
  Options: --sub-file <subtitle file> [--sub-fps, --sub-delay --sub-format].

  * modules/demux/avi : make use of subtitle parser.
  * modules/demux/asf : display movie length. (It will not work with live
 streams of course).

  modules/codec/spudec : use i_dts to send end of display time for subtitle.
 (Yes it's ugly, but it works :)

2002-11-15 Friday 17:17  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/audio_output/arts.c, modules/audio_output/esd.c:

    (untested).

2002-11-15 Friday 16:27  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/audio_output/directx.c, modules/audio_output/waveout.c:
    fixed the waveout and directx audio plugins after the recent changes to aout3.

2002-11-15 Friday 14:41  gbazin

    the new changes in aout3.

2002-11-14 Thursday 22:44  alexis

 Added the changelog of vlc 0.4.6.

2002-11-14 Thursday 22:38  massiot

 Major change of the channels management. p_format->i_channels disappeares
 and is replaced by two members : i_physical_channels and i_original_channels.
 i_physical_channels describes the channels which are effectively present
 in the stream (at the current point of the aout pipeline), whereas
 i_original_channels represents the channels we used to constitute the
 stream. For instance a mono stream (FRONT_CENTER) may emanate from a
 FRONT_LEFT channel of a STEREO stream.

 Additionally, this contains hooks to dynamically select the audio device
 and the channels configuration. In order to do that, all aout plugins,
 and all interface plug-ins need to be adapted. Currently only SDL
 (partially OSS) and the rc interface have been adapted, please use them
 as a guide. Other aout plug-ins have been temporarily disabled.

 IMPORTANT : if you need a working sound output, DO NOT UPDATE YOUR TREE
 for several days until we fix that.

 * modules/misc/network/ipv4.c: Fixed a long-standing segfault when saving
   preferences and asking for multicast.

   * ./bootstrap: bootstrap now requires the --config flag. With no arguments
     it simply outputs a usage message.
   * ./src/*: fixed a bunch of (legitimate) warnings under VC++.
   * ./evc/*, ./msvc/*: split the workspaces into three projects (libvlc, vlc
     and plugins -- plugins doesn't build anything yet).

   * ./msvc/*, ./evc/*: moved eMbedded Visual Studio files to the toplevel evc/
     directory because the two project files are starting to diverge.
   * ./evc/vlc.c: created a specific vlc.c file for Windows CE.
   * ./src/misc/messages.c: as WinCE doesn't have stdout or stderr, the message
     queue outputs to a logfile (until we have a proper interface).

2002-11-13 Wednesday 12:58  gbazin

 * src/playlist/playlist.c: bugfix for when we delete the last playlist

 otherwise you'll have to force it.

2002-11-12 Tuesday 21:20  gbazin

 * include/vlc_playlist.h, src/playlist/playlist.c: added a b_autodeletion

  * modules/access/mms : add MMS (Microsoft Media Streaming) access (Support
 only TCP, I will try to add UDP and HTTP as well).
  There are some problems with streams selections and we cannot seek, but
 anyway it seems to work. (Usefull for some radio web)
  * other: enable mms access by default.

 * src/audio_output/filters.c, src/audio_output/input.c, include/aout_internal.h,
    modules/audio_filter/resampler/*: Changes that allow the resamplers to set
    the start and end date of the frame it outputs.
    This allows us for instance to output a smaller frame than what we should, and
    keep the rest of the data to compute the resampling of the next frame.
    In short, we can implement much more complex resampling algorithms than before.

 * modules/audio_filter/resampler/linear.c: rewrote the linear resampler. The audio
    quality doesn't seem to be better than the ugly resampler, maybe I shouldn't
    have wasted my time on this...

2002-11-11 Monday 19:16  gbazin

 * modules/audio_output/file.c: will write a WAV header by default. Can be
    disabled with --no-audiofile-wav.
 * modules/audio_filter/resampler/linear.c: disabled for now, until I actually
    manage to make it work without a problem.

2002-11-11 Monday 14:39  sam

   * ./include/*, ./src/*: separated WIN32 #tests and UNDER_CE #tests, because
     WIN32 isn't always defined under WinCE, but might be. Grmbl.
   * ./include/*: changed a few u* and s* to uint*_t and int*_t.

2002-11-10 Sunday 23:41  sam

   * ALL: libvlc now compiles and run under WinCE. I haven't ported any modules
     yet so there's little that can be tested, but threads work at least.
   * ./src/extras/libc.c: renamed strndup.c to libc.c because a few other
     libc functions were added (strcasecmp, atof, getenv...).

2002-11-10 Sunday 18:04  sam

   * ALL: WinCE compilation fixes (mostly nonexistent headers). A lot of
     work is still needed for missing functions. I only touched libvlc for
     the moment, plugins will come in a long long while.
   * ./bootstrap: moved MSVC project files generation here; use --update-msvc.

2002-11-10 Sunday 16:31  fenrir

  all: fix a bug in packet parsing and can now play unseekable stream.

2002-11-10 Sunday 15:37  fenrir

  http: Accept ICY server reponse (Used for some web radio) and in that
 case it forces mp3 demuxer (Should be ok...)

2002-11-10 Sunday 14:31  gbazin

 * src/audio_output/output.c: fixed another quality affecting bug.

 * include/aout_internal.h src/audio_output/input.c: major change to the
    resampling algorithm. When resampling is requested to keep the audio stream
    synchronised to the main clock, we trigger it but we change the resampling
    rate only progressively so it doesn't get noticed too much by the listener.

2002-11-10 Sunday 13:24  sigmunau

  ./ChangeLog: added entry for the linear resampler
  ./modules/audio_filter/resampler/linear.c: This should allways generate the
 right number of samples now. The morale is never base your floating point
 calculations on the output of integer divitions.

2002-11-10 Sunday 02:47  fenrir

  * faad : adapt to newer version.
  * ffmpeg : adapt postprocessing for latest libavcodec version, add an
 option to disable direct rendering as postprocessing is currently broken
 with it, and with some files I have bad pictures.

2002-11-09 Saturday 18:28  sam

   * ./msvc/vlc.dsp: additional fixes to the MSVC project.
   * ./msvc/vlc.vcw: skeleton of a WinCE project file (yet non-functional).

2002-11-09 Saturday 18:28  sam

  * ./include/aout_internal.h: fixed a breakage I just introduced.

2002-11-09 Saturday 17:44  sam

   * A few additional MSVC build fixes.

2002-11-09 Saturday 16:39  sam

   * ./msvc/*: MSVC project files and default config files.

2002-11-09 Saturday 16:34  sam

   * ./Makefile.am: added a "update-vlc.dsp" rule to create the MSVC project
     file from the makefile.
   * ./msvc/*: moved the MSVC files here.
   * ./src/extras/*: moved the extra code here (used to be in src/misc,
     extras/GNUgetopt and extras/Win32_msvc).
   * ./include/*: a few warning fixes.

2002-11-08 Friday 14:23  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/audio_filter/converter/*: added a s8tofloat32.c and
    u8tofloat32.c converter.
 * modules/codec/araw.c: modified to also decode u8 pcm audio samples.

2002-11-08 Friday 10:26  gbazin

 * ALL: using "%ll" in printf format strings is not portable (notably on win32) so
    we now use the I64Fx familly of macros to print 64 bits numbers (x being
    replaced by d,i,o,u,x or X).
    eg: msg_Dbg( p_this, "sample is "I64Fi" late", ll_time );

 * src/misc/messages.c: got rid of ConvertPrintfFormatString().

2002-11-07 Thursday 22:56  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h: compilation fix for Cygwin.

2002-11-07 Thursday 21:09  sigmunau

  added a new resampler based on linear interpolation, giving a fair tradeoff
 between sound quality and speed

2002-11-07 Thursday 19:31  gbazin

 * INSTALL.win32, include/vlc_config.h, src/libvlc.h: changes to reflect the
    fact that libdvdcss now needs a colon after the DVD drive letter (on Win32).

 * src/misc/messages.c: on Win32 only use fflush() if in debug mode.

 * src/misc/win32_specific.c: try to raise the our process priority slightly
    above normal. This prevent us from suffering too much from normal activity
    of the OS.

2002-11-07 Thursday 16:54  gbazin

 * modules/access/http.c: don't crash, but complain on non http/1.x streams.

2002-11-06 Wednesday 21:48  gbazin

 * modules/codec/spudec/*: modified the spu decoder to handle text subtitles.
    Only one format of text subtitles is supported right now but we should be able
    to expand this by modifying modules/codec/spudec/text.c.
    Most of this work comes from by Andrew Flintham ( thanks a bunch Andrew :).

 * share/font-eutopiabold36.rle: new font for the text subtitler, courtesy of
    Andrew Flintham.

 * AUTHORS: added Andrew Flintham to the authors file.

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: modified the ogg demuxer to handle subtitles.

 * modules/codec/ffmpeg/*: modified the ffmpeg decoder to always keep the last decoded
    frame linked.

2002-11-06 Wednesday 18:07  sam

   * ./modules/access/dvdplay/access.c: activated button highlighting.
   * ./modules/codec/spudec/parse.c: implemented subtitle cropping and
     temporarily disabled subtitle cropping.
   * ./modules/codec/spudec/render.c: split RenderSPU into chroma-specific
     functions.

2002-11-06 Wednesday 15:41  jobi

   * modules/access/vcd/vcd.*: added entry points support (sort of
     chapters).
   * modules/gui/gtk/gtk_callbacks.c: added some locks to the
     navigation functions

2002-11-06 Wednesday 14:44  sam

   * ./modules/demux/avi/avi.c, ./modules/demux/avi/libavi.c: additional
     endianness fixes, spelling fixes, reworked return values usage, used
     C99 types.

2002-11-06 Wednesday 09:26  sam

   * ./src/misc/extras.c: removed a duplicate calculation inside a macro.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: fixed a bug causing all commandline targets to be ignored
     for playback except the last one.
   * ./modules/codec/dv.c: we detach p_vout before quitting.
   * ./modules/codec/xvid.c: fixed image corruption, added a direct rendering
     option which doesn't work yet.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 23:48  gbazin

 * modules/demux/avi/*: should theoretically fix the endianness issues with
    the avi demuxer.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 22:53  sam

   * ./modules/codec/xvid.c: beginning of a video decoder using the Xvid codec
     from xvid.org; compile with --enable-xvid --with-xvid-tree=..., run with
     --codec xvid,any (the priority is lower than ffmpeg's for the now).

     todo list: direct rendering, better buffer handling, see why only I frames
                are rendered OK here... probably more.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 21:57  gbazin

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: should theoretically work on Big Endian machines now.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 18:25  gbazin

 * All: moved the check for "video" and "audio" config variables to
    input_SelectES(). That allows --no-video and --no-audio to automagically
    work for all demuxers.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 14:52  sam

   * ./codec/dv/dv.c: moved this single file to its parent directory; removed
     GetFirstPES in favour of input_ExtractPES/input_DeletePES calls.

2002-11-05 Tuesday 10:07  gbazin

 * modules/codec/ffmpeg/*: modified the ffmpeg video codec to use direct
    rendering when possible.
    Use BITMAPINFOHEADER from include/codecs.h + got rid of Little Endian
    translations that were already done in the demux.
 * modules/demux/avi/* modules/demux/asf/*: Use BITMAPINFOHEADER from
    include/codecs.h.

   * ./Makefile.am: we properly install plugins in the OS X vlc.app directory.
   * ./mozilla/npvlc_rc.rc, ./mozilla/vlcplugin.h: added the Ogg mime type to
     the Mozilla plugin properties.
   * ./debian/control: added libogg-dev and libvorbis-dev dependicies to the
     Debian build script.

2002-11-03 Sunday 23:00  gbazin

 * include/codecs.h: new header file to store information shared by decoders
    and demuxers, like the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure for instance.
 * modules/demux/ogg.c: the ogg demuxer should now work nicely with ogm files
    (including for the video). It has only been tested with a few streams
    produced with dvd::rip and ogmmerge though.

2002-11-03 Sunday 13:22  gbazin

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: we now correctly handle multiple vorbis logical streams
    in ogm files.
 * modules/codec/vorbis.c: small bugfix.

2002-11-02 Saturday 22:47  gbazin

 * modules/demux/ogg.c: small fix to avoid crashing when find unknown codecs.

2002-11-02 Saturday 18:13  gbazin

 * modules/demux/ogg.c, modules/codec/vorbis.c: seeking in an ogg stream is
    working fine now, + misc other improvements.

2002-11-02 Saturday 17:31  sigmunau

 modules/codec/dv/dv.h: workaround for a namespace collision (#undef vlc_error)
 debian/rules: update the location of libgnome_main_plugin.so and
 libgtk_main_plugin.so. Added the ui.rc file to the kvlc package. All debian
 packages seem to build now (even though there were some warnings)

2002-11-02 Saturday 11:53  gbazin

 * src/video_output/video_output.c: small change to avoid using floating point
    registers in the video ouptut routines.

2002-11-01 Friday 23:06  jpsaman

 --enable-familiar accepts now:
 --with-sdl-prefix=[PATH], --enable-gtk-prefix=[PATH] and --enable-gpe-prefix=[PATH] to enable cross-compiling.

2002-11-01 Friday 15:43  gbazin

 * modules/audio_output/directx.c: forgot an aout_BufferFree().

2002-11-01 Friday 15:06  gbazin

 * src/audio_output/common.c, include/aout_internal.h: added a new function
    aout_FifoFirstDate() that allows the aout plugin to schedule the first
    play.
 * src/audio_output/output.c: fixed another problem affecting the audio quality.
 * modules/audio_output/directx.c: improvements. The buffering scheme has been
    changed to be less affected by temporary starving. We also schedule the first   sample to play.

2002-11-01 Friday 12:52  sigmunau

 fixed a typo that caused the ui.rc file to be installed in PREFIX/sharevlc/

2002-10-31 Thursday 11:16  sam

   * ./src/misc/variables.c: callbacks are now called after the variable has
     been modified. Maybe we'll need the other type, too, but this change will
     make things simpler in aout3.

   * ./src/playlist/playlist.c: removed two unused variables.
   * ./src/misc/modules.c: removed a debug message I had forgotten.
   * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h.in: fixed a typo (thanks bozo).

2002-10-31 Thursday 09:40  gbazin

 * modules/codec/spudec/spudec.c, modules/codec/spudec/parse.c: fixed a couple
    of problems introduced with the recent changes to the bitstream facility.
 * src/audio_output/output.c: fixed a quite annoying bug in aout3 that was
    triggering unnecessary trashing of audio frames.

   * ./configure.ac.in: we explicitely link the dvdplay plugin with libdvdcss

   * ./modules/access/dvdplay/tools.c: we don't try to stat the device if it
     looks like a Win32 drive.

 * ALL: removed GetPES and NextPES, we now use input_ExtractPES everywhere instead
    of these. The bitstream facility has also been changed to use input_ExtractPES
    and now stores the current PES in its structure.
    Introduced input_FlushPESFifo() and CloseBitstream().

  Just a word: now we cannot update anymore p_input->p_current_data

 mp3 demux (not yet fixed), I don't known if it's used elsewhere....

2002-10-26 Saturday 15:24  gbazin

 * ALL: p_selected_area->i_tell is now update inside input_SplitBuffer instead
    of inside the pf_read functions of access plugins. That means i_tell now
    actually reflects the position of what is being decoded and furthermore it
    is updated more often.

   * ./modules/video_output/directx/events.c: support for drawing in a parent
     window instead of creating our own; still a bit flakey.

   * ./mozilla/vlcshell.cpp: we can now compile the Mozilla plugin so that it
     does not call libvlc (for testing purposes).

 * modules/audio_output/oss.c: when now set the fragment size of the OSS device
    according to the size of an audio sample.
    For buggy OSS drivers, we now take into account the real size of the OSS
    internal buffer when we check how much this buffer has been filled.

2002-10-25 Friday 09:24  sam

   * ./bootstrap, ./Makefile.am: we don't build static libraries if their only
     goal is to provide dependencies for shared libraries.

2002-10-25 Friday 09:21  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h: we now use the ISO C9x types (int8_t, uint8_t,
     int16_t) instead of our custom types (s8, u8, s16) and you are encouraged
     to use these types from now. Of course the old types are still available
     for backward compatibility.

     For the moment it spawns a separate window and seems to behave nastily
     (read: crashes) when the target has sound, but the javascript interface
     works perfectly, for instance.

     To build it, I installed Mozilla development files in my mingw32 dir
     and hacked mozilla-config so that it uses these files. I also hacked
     jri_md.h and jni_md.h to put "defined(_MSC_VER) || defined(__MINGW32__)"
     where it read "defined(_MSC_VER)". No other changes were necessary.

2002-10-20 Sunday 12:23  massiot

 * modules/demux/mpeg: Added DVB stream type for A/52 streams (0x6),
 * include/vlc_threads.h: Avoid locking the interface,
 * ALL: reworked all audio output plug-ins to correctly take into account
   i_channels. At present this is known to break OSS, probably others.

 * ./modules/video_output/directx/events.c: compilation fix

2002-10-17 Thursday 16:56  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/directx/events.c: mouse coordinates support for
     the DirectX plugin (please test compilation).

2002-10-17 Thursday 16:48  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/sdl.c: mouse coordinates support for SDL.
   * ./modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: we transmit the click only at
     release time.

2002-10-17 Thursday 16:03  sam

   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: mouse coordinates are now variables.
   * ./modules/access/dvdplay/intf.c: instead of probing the mouse on each
     loop iteration, we set a callback on the corresponding variables.

2002-10-17 Thursday 13:15  sam

   * ./src/misc/variables.c: callback loops are now detected; this means you
     can now use var_* functions from within your callback, they can even
     trigger callback themselves, to any level. The main restriction is that
     you shouldn't meddle with a variable that is already being triggered by
     the current thread (other threads will just wait).
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: fixed a deadlock in the "tree" command.
   * ./modules/misc/testsuite/test4.c: added a "callback-test" command to the
     rc interface to test callback loop detection and concurrent triggers.

2002-10-17 Thursday 08:24  sam

   * ./modules/codec/spudec/parse.c: fixed bad initialization of the alpha
     palette, implemented the "force display" command as forever-living
     subtitles, and reworked some code.
   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: we increment the image date even if
     we are repeating the previous image, so that subtitles have a chance to
     get displayed.
   * ./src/video_output/vout_subpictures.c: ephemer subpictures don't timeout.

2002-10-16 Wednesday 15:10  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in, ./src/libvlc.c: attempt at activating gettext support
     under platforms without libintl such as Win32. Use --with-included-gettext
     to test. Might break compilation on systems I don't have access to.

2002-10-16 Wednesday 11:35  sam

   * ./modules/access/vcd/vcd.c: changed an error to a warning in the probe
     phase.
   * ./modules/video_filter/deinterlace/deinterlace.c: the bob method now
     flickers less thanks to a patch from Marian Durkovic <md@bts.sk>.

2002-10-16 Wednesday 10:31  sam

2002-10-15 Tuesday 19:56  gbazin

 * modules/access/vcd/*, configure.ac.in:
    - Major changes to allow reading vcd images directly from the hard drive
       (you need a .cue and .bin file).
    - Removed duplicated code by merging ioctl_GetTrackCount and ioctl_GetSectors.
    - Implemented necessary ioctls for Win9x/NT/2K/XP.

   --avi-interleaved force method used for unseekable stream but need
 interleaved stream and could lead to loss of audio/video synchro.

 Fixed seeking.

2002-10-14 Monday 19:04  sam

   * ./modules/misc/testsuite/test4.c: made the 4th test less CPU intensive
     by making the spawned threads wait a bit longer.
   * ./src/misc/variables.c: added a usage count to the variables; trying to
     create a variable with the same name only increments its refcount.

2002-10-14 Monday 16:46  sam

   * ./include/vlc/vlc.h, ./src/libvlc.c: added VLC_Error() to the libvlc API.
   * ./include/main.h: removed p_vlc->i_status because it was not sufficient
     to represent all the possible states of p_vlc; each part should be tested
     separately upon destruction.
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: fixed a signed/unsigned bug that prevented creation
     of VLC_OBJECT_GENERIC objects.

   * ./src/misc/variables.c: added the VLC_VAR_COMMAND type which is simply a
     variable that stores a function pointer, and calls it when var_Get is
     called for it. The function argument is taken in val.psz_string.
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: vlc_dumpstructure and vlc_liststructure are no longer
     exported to the rest of the program; instead, they're VLC_VAR_COMMAND vars
     ("tree" and "list").
   * ./modules/control/rc/rc.c: moved a few commands to VLC_VAR_COMMAND vars.

2002-10-14 Monday 16:35  sam

   * ./src/misc/error.c: added vlc_error, a strerror() equivalent.

2002-10-14 Monday 16:34  sam

   * ./modules/misc/testsuite/test4.c: added a stress test module; doesn't get
     compiled yet because it uses the "command" variables I'm about to check
     in. They need to be typed in the rc interface for instance (-I rc). This
     module has two available commands: "signal <int>" which sends the given
     signal to the vlc process, and "stress [<int>]" which performs a series of
     object creation/lookup/destruction, variable creation/setting/destruction
     and thread spawning/joining tests. The optional argument for stress is an
     integer between 1 and 200 (the bigger, the heavier the tests; it may hang
     your machine at around 150, be careful).

 * Updated project files for 0.4.5 release.

2002-10-11 Friday 22:32  sam

 Changes to the libvlc API:
   * ./include/vlc/vlc.h: changed the naming conventions for libvlc. Now
     exported functions start with VLC_ instead of vlc_ to avoid conflicts.
   * ./include/vlc/vlc.h: removed the vlc_object_t, vlc_list_t, vlc_error_t
     and vlc_t types; they are now internal types only.
   * ./include/vlc/vlc.h: merged the reentrant and non-reentrant libvlc
     calls. In non-reentrant mode, we just use 0 as the first argument. In
     reentrant mode, we use an object's ID. (see below)

 Internal changes:
   * ./src/libvlc.c, ./src/misc/objects.c: instead of manipulating vlc_object_t
     pointers, we manipulate their i_object_id. When needed, an object is
     retrieved using vlc_object_get (I hope the lookup isn't too expensive,
     that's why I designed the pp_objects layout to allow log2(n) seeks).
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: activated the per-object variable storage. Unused
     yet, unless you want to try "getfoo" and "setfoo blablah" in vlc -I rc.
   * ./include/vlc_objects.h: moved the vlc_object_t and vlc_list_t definitions
     here.

 Misc:
   * ./src/vlc.c, ./mozilla/vlcshell.cpp: removed inclusion of config.h in
     code portions not part of libvlc; it was just required for the
     COPYRIGHT_MESSAGE string which is now available from VLC_Version().

2002-10-11 Friday 21:17  sam

   * ./plugins/filter/deinterlace.c: fixed the green bottom line in the
     linear deinterlace mode, thanks to Marian Durkovic <md@bts.sk>.

2002-10-11 Friday 17:29  gbazin

 * INSTALL.win32: removed note about running in administrator mode to play
    a DVD. Updated doc about using cygwin for compiling.

2002-10-11 Friday 11:05  sam

   * ./src/misc/variables.c, ./include/variables.h: a few functions for
     in-object variable storage. Unused yet (not even compiled).

2002-10-11 Friday 10:08  gbazin

 * src/misc/modules.c: fixed a memory leak with the "plugin-path" config option.
 * modules/audio_output/directx.c, modules/audio_output/waveout.c: ported the directx
    and waveout audio plugins to the new changes in the audio output layer.
 * configure.ac.in: fixes for cygwin compilation, and the gtk plugin under mingw32.

2002-10-11 Friday 09:01  gbazin

 * src/interface/main.c, src/misc/modules.c: added a quick hack for a
    --plugin-path command line option.
 * INSTALL.win32: removed note about running in administrator mode to play
    a DVD.

 Do not use vasprintf under Mac OS X because OS X.1 doesn't have that (how
 lame...).

2002-10-10 Thursday 19:34  sigmunau

  messages.cpp: use append(...) and not setText( text() + ...), seems to

  preferences.cpp: allow config strings to be 40 characters long instead of
 10. Is that enough?

   * ./configure.ac.in: dropped the use of typeset in favor of eval to

 OS X : raised the priority of the intf at the same level as the video, since
 otherwise we can't quit the application any longer...

2002-10-08 Tuesday 18:10  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.c, ./src/misc/messages.c: due to horrible user threats,
     only two levels of -v are now possible: -v for warnings, -vv for debug
     messages (-q for no output at all).

2002-10-08 Tuesday 16:02  sam

   * ./src/input/input.c: do not try to use stream output if the "sout" variable
     is set to the empty string (happens when doing "Apply" in a GUI).

   ./extras/MacOSX/.../MainMenu.nib: added Open Target panel
   ./modules/gui/macosx/open.[mh]: Open Target code

2002-10-04 Friday 18:07  sam

   * ./configure.ac.in: removed now unnecessary --force-exe-suffix flag.
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: structure_lock is now local.
   * ./src/misc/threads.c: implemented named mutexes which provide a handy
     way to protect data across plugins which might be sharing the same
     resources. Thread-unsafe libraries come to mind, but we can imagine
     using a named mutex for configuration files, or special devices.
   * ./include/main.h: removed global_lock because of vlc_mutex_need, removed
     p_global_data because it was never used, removed structure_lock because
     it did not belong here.

2002-10-04 Friday 14:02  sam

   * ./modules/gui/macosx/vout.m: if no MacOS X interface is available when
     the video output is initialized, we wait for a while before giving up;
     also changed the code so that it probes all interface objects rather than
     the first one it finds.

2002-10-04 Friday 13:13  sam

   * ./bootstrap: we use the proper linker for plugin compilation.
   * ./modules/misc/testsuite/*: moved the null module into three test modules
     that are only built when --enable-testsuite is activated. This directory
     can be a good place for compilation tests or performance benchmarks.

2002-10-04 Friday 12:01  gbazin

 * src/misc/threads.c, src/misc/win32_specific.c, include/interface.h: fixed typos.
 * configure.ac.in, modules/gui/gtk/gtk.c: Added a NEED_GTK_MAIN macro to the compiler
    flags for the gtk module. When this macro isn't defined, then the gtk module
    doesn't make use of the gtk_main module. I had to do this change because the
    gtk_main trick can't work on win32 and render the whole gtk interface unusable.

   * ./configure.ac.in: duplicated arguments to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to fix
     locales breakage.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: libvlc understands the VLC_VERBOSE environment variable,
     to be set between 0 and 4. Default value is 0 for a program using libvlc,
     but vlc sets it to 1 by default.
   * ./src/misc/configuration.c: -v now works the old way (-v, -vv, -vvv) as
     well as the new way (-v0, -v1, -v4). -v1 is the same as -v, and -v0 is
     the same as -q (quiet). Hope it's all understandable.

2002-10-03 Thursday 13:21  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.c, ./include/main.h: the root of all objects is now
     p_libvlc, and each p_vlc is a child of p_libvlc. Reasons for this are:

      o the module bank and the message bank only need to be initialized once,
        which gives faster loads when multiple instances of libvlc are used,
      o we allow the possibility of different p_vlc sharing objects, for
        instance the audio output,
      o the CPU detection is only done once.

     This patch is not polished yet, but I cannot do any intensive tests for
     the moment because of a bug somewhere that leaves audio output objects
     lying here and there which needs to be investigated first. The current
     major issue is that the module bank is no longer freed.

 lpcm support (tested on 1 source only)

2002-09-17 Tuesday 14:56  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.c: switched the position of msg_Create() and system_Init()
     because the BeOS system_Init spawns a thread, which makes use of msg_*
     functions.
   * ./src/misc/threads.c, ./src/misc/win32_specific.c: put the detection
     of SignalObjectAndWait in the thread system initialization because
     system_Init() now happens after msg_Create().

2002-09-17 Tuesday 11:57  fenrir

  * all: - fix a memory leak while parsing.
         - fix a bug while playing last frames (in last chunk).
         - add seek support, not complete but usable.

2002-09-17 Tuesday 08:18  sam

   * ./mozilla/*: added hooks so that the vlc plugin is scriptable from

 * configure.in: Fixed detection of Qt-embedded.
 * modules/codec/a52.c: Fixed detection of A/52 sound.

     chroma parsing.

2002-09-10 Tuesday 12:15  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: if we do not own the X window, like
     in the Mozilla plugin, we do not try to unmap it.

2002-09-09 Monday 13:52  sam

   * ./configure.in: the DV module is now a plugin, with the proper
     dependencies in debian/control.

 Added Stephan Assmus who is helping with the BeOS Code

2002-09-03 Tuesday 12:00  tcastley

 src/misc/beos_specific.cpp:
 - Implemented VlcApplication::RefsReceived()
 - this added ability to open a file by dropping its icon onto the vlc icon
 - this makes Open With... work as well
 plugins/beos/intf_beos.cpp

 - blanks cursor when no activity
 - Fixed a memory leak in VideoWindow::ScreenChanged()
 - Fixed the ugly scrambled video content before any decoding actually begins
 - Added selectable aspect ratio correction
 - Added better error handling when setting the drawing mode
 plugins/beos/InterfaceWindow.h/.cpp

2002-09-02 Monday 23:21  massiot

 Fixed the trivial channel mixer.

2002-09-02 Monday 23:17  massiot

 The liba52 "codec" is now an audio filter. It means we are now able to
 autodetect S/PDIF hardware support and the audio output plug-in chooses
 the best one. Of course it probably breaks existing output modules, see
 oss.c for hints :).

 Also include minor tweaks which will entitle us to decode and output 5.1
 audio. It may break existing plug-ins, too. See
 audio_output.c:aout_FormatNbChannels for hints.

2002-09-01 Sunday 21:20  massiot

 Added a priority for video decoders, for systems with fixed-priority
 policy.

2002-08-31 Saturday 22:10  stef

 *It seems that the setting of the fragment size was buggy.

 OSS work with my sblive! now :). It still works on my other computer too
 but please test.

2002-08-31 Saturday 19:58  stef

 *Make pf_setformat disappear from sdl module.

2002-08-30 Friday 23:27  massiot

 aout3 API change :
 pf_setformat disappears (it was never called independantly of Open). If
 the format needs to be changed, we will have Close/Open. This is much
 simpler than before. Please check that I didn't break some plug-ins.

2002-08-30 Friday 22:22  massiot

 * demuxes: Worked around a bug in old VLC and VLS by changing TS stream types
   (see my last mail).
 * aout: Rewrote our whole lock policy. The output thread now doesn't require
   the mixer_lock, which might avoid delays. We will also be able to change
   the filter pipelines at runtime.

2002-08-30 Friday 19:16  sam

   * ./include/vlc_threads_funcs.h, modules/video_output/directx/vout.c: Win32
     compilation fixes (typo, undeclared var).

2002-08-30 Friday 12:23  sam

   * ./configure.in: do not try to link with -lrt if not using pthreads. This
     might break the HP/UX or Solaris ports, please check if possible.
   * ./src/misc/threads.c: fixed syntax in the st and pth implementations.

2002-08-29 Thursday 23:53  massiot

 * ./bootstrap : Fixed an issue with old shell versions
 * ALL : Added a priority argument to vlc_thread_create(), so that audio
 and input threads can run with a higher real-time priority, on systems
 allowing you to use priorities.

2002-08-29 Thursday 22:29  ipkiss

 The win32 interface is preparing for the internationalization.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 22:44  massiot

 * Fixed libmad's output volume.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 22:25  massiot

 * Finally fixed the segfault when resampling.
 * Reactivated the A/52 demux.
 * Wrote a real full-featured float32 mixer.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 21:40  sam

   * ./Makefile.old: fixed the automatic dependency rule (include dirs missing).

2002-08-28 Wednesday 19:48  massiot

 It now works when there is no automake-1.5 nor automake-1.6.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 15:30  sam

   * ./m4/*: added gettext m4 macros so that the configure behaviour is
     always the same.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 14:22  sam

   * Additional fixes for bootstrap when gettext isn't available.

2002-08-28 Wednesday 13:38  sam

   * ./bootstrap: fixed a shell error (replaced "if `foo`" with "if foo").

2002-08-28 Wednesday 12:50  sam

   * ./bootstrap: we should be able to bootstrap CVS even without gettext.

2002-08-27 Tuesday 21:53  sigmunau

 fixed a minor bug

2002-08-27 Tuesday 14:15  sam

   * ./HACKING: we can now use automake-1.5 instead of automake-1.6. But now
     we _really_ depend on it.
   * ./bootstrap: we don't use touch to create a file, because it doesn't seem
     to work everywhere.

2002-08-26 Monday 23:36  sam

   * ./bootstrap: we touch m4/Makefile.am so that configure doesn't complain
     about a missing m4/Makefile.in.
   * ./include/vlc_common.h: workaround for Borland's redefinition of PACKAGE.

2002-08-26 Monday 23:00  massiot

 * Miscellaneous S/PDIF fixes.
 * New NextPTS() function, to replace CurrentPTS() (gives the PTS which will
   be valid for NEXT byte).
 * Fixed mono mode in the builtin mpeg audio decoder.
 * Various fixes related to PTS calculation in audio decoders.

2002-08-26 Monday 22:54  sigmunau

 have my filter compile by default

2002-08-26 Monday 22:35  sigmunau

 An motion blur filter. --blur-factor states the degree of blurring from 1
 to 127. about 100 is cool

2002-08-26 Monday 21:46  sam

   * ./bootstrap: another fix for old versions of autoconf which don't seem
     to like the gettext m4 files.

2002-08-26 Monday 20:49  sam

   * ./configure.in: we now require autoconf 2.5x because previous versions
     don't seem to work very well if you are using autopoint, although
     gettext 0.11.5 claims to be fully backwards compatible. Welcome to
     automake hell.
   * ./bootstrap: workaround which uses gettextize if you do not have
     autopoint. We'll probably stay like this for a while, until gettext
     0.11.x (which replaces gettextize with autopoint) becomes more
     widespread. Currently this workaround seems to work, but don't expect
     a clean tarball if you make dist without having used autopoint. Welcome
     to automake hell.

2002-08-26 Monday 10:02  sam

   * ./Makefile.old, ./modules/gui/win32/win32.bpr: fixed header location
     issues in the Win32 build.

2002-08-26 Monday 09:38  sam

   * ./bootstrap: dropped the dependency on gettext 0.11.5. Now 0.10.4 is OK.

2002-08-26 Monday 09:12  sam

    (A few minor pending patches I had around)
   * ./debian/control: gnome-vlc recommends vlc-plugin-esd, and kvlc recommends
     vlc-plugin-arts.
   * ./src/misc/messages.c: message queue now prints the current object type.
   * ./modules/*: cosmetic fixes for the --long-help output.

2002-08-26 Monday 08:36  sam

   * ALL: fixed a few include directories.

2002-08-26 Monday 01:01  sam

   * Moved ./include/defs.h to ./config.h
   * Renamed ./include/config.h to ./include/vlc_config.h
   * Other misc auto* fixes.

2002-08-25 Sunday 23:18  sam

   * ALL: started the slow move to automake. For the moment, the changes are
     unnoticeable apart from the extra dependency on autoconf, automake and
     gettextize. See the new HACKING file for some information, especially if
     you don't run Linux.

     The current strategy is to have the configure script generate a nice
     automake Makefile from Makefile.am, and then clobber it with our good
     old dirty Makefile. Muahaha :-)

2002-08-25 Sunday 20:44  jpsaman

 Directory content is now read at startup.

2002-08-25 Sunday 19:27  sam

   * ./src/playlist/playlist.c: -Z flag makes playlist loop endlessly.

2002-08-25 Sunday 17:22  ipkiss

  * all: Unified behaviours using "action list" objects

2002-08-25 Sunday 16:55  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c, ./modules/audio_output/sdl.c: improved
     sound synchronization.
   * ./src/audio_output/output.c: reverted another change I previously did :-)

2002-08-25 Sunday 09:39  sam

   * ./src/audio_output/output.c: reverted my previous aout_OutputNextBuffer
     prototype change; it looks like we won't need it after all.
   * ./src/audio_output/output.c: if audio output is too slow, but we
     know there is no next packet, then we play it anyway. Rationale behind
     this is: better play a slightly wrongly dated packet than play silence,
     because it might be wrongly dated but there are chances it won't break
     audio continuity.
   * ./modules/audio_output/sdl.c: workaround for SDL's crap audio output
     system (callback gets called at random times, and no way to know the
     latency of the samples being played). Audio output is now rather good
     here, but please give feedback.
   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: we delay a bit before asking for a new
     buffer to avoid starvation.

2002-08-24 Saturday 21:35  sigmunau

  moved id3 related code to a separate utility module since several
 demuxers need it

2002-08-24 Saturday 21:11  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: we don't ask too early for a new buffer,
     but rather sleep a bit.

2002-08-24 Saturday 20:22  sam

   * ./modules/audio_filter/resampler/ugly.c: simple resampler which does not
     insert blank samples, but changes pitch.

2002-08-24 Saturday 17:04  gbazin

 * modules/misc/logger/logger.c: fixed initialization bugs.
 * src/misc/objects.c: in vlc_object_destroy() there's no need to lock structure_lock if
 we are the root object (structure_lock has already been destroyed anyway).

2002-08-24 Saturday 16:07  sam

   * ./modules/audio_filter/resampler/trivial.c: fixed a buffer size calculation
     issue in the trivial resampler.

2002-08-24 Saturday 14:49  sam

   * ./configure.in: fixed a typo that prevented compilation of the network
     modules.
   * ./debian/rules: added faad to the package generation.

2002-08-24 Saturday 11:57  sam

   * ./modules/gui/gtk/open.c: the Gtk and GNOME interfaces no longer ignore
     the "dvd", "frequency" and "symbol-rate" variables.

2002-08-24 Saturday 11:46  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: fixed a bug on module reopening.
   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: we now properly set the fragment size.

2002-08-24 Saturday 10:19  sam

   * ./src/audio_output/output.c: added an argument to aout_OutputNextBuffer
     which lets the audio output module give a timeout value for buffer
     delivery. This fixes a few issues with aout modules which were calling
     aout_OutputNextBuffer way too early.

2002-08-24 Saturday 09:55  sam

   * ./debian/*: created legacy packages for smooth upgrades to the upcoming
     0.5.x version, and created the vlc-plugin-svgalib package.

2002-08-24 Saturday 01:14  sigmunau

  fixed an off by factor 10 error. Noted along the way that this module
 seems to be requesting audio some time before the output pipeline is
 finnished

2002-08-23 Friday 14:16  tcastley

 Rewritten aout3.  BeOS currently PUSHES the audio.

   * ./modules/codec/faad/decoder.c: the AAC decoder is in sync with aout3.
   * ./modules/codec/a52old/a52old.c: the a52old decoder as well.

2002-08-22 Thursday 17:14  sam

   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/fixed32tofloat32.c: fixed conversion.
   * ./modules/codec/mad/libmad.c: ported to the latest aout changes. Still
     doesn't work here, though.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 23:19  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h: declared aout_fifo_t.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 23:17  sam

   * ./include/aout_internal.h: exported aout_FifoPop to plugins.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 22:41  massiot

 Big round of fixes in the aout3.
 * Audio and video should now _always_ be perfectly in sync.
 * Changes in a52.c (end_date management) must be ported to other codecs,
   otherwise mixer errors will appear.
 * Audio output plug-in can now tell whether they can handle a little
   clock drift (for instance, inserting zeroes after a pause).

2002-08-21 Wednesday 19:30  jpsaman

 Stopping vlc from the Familiar interface is possible again.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 17:31  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: if a plugin requested not to be unloaded, then we
     won't unload it. This makes us more fault-tolerant with crap libraries
     that are making use of atexit().
   * ./configure.in: svgalib can now be a plugin.
   * ./modules/misc/gtk_main.c: gtk_main doesn't need g_atexit anymore.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 15:55  sam

   * ./modules/misc/gtk_main.c: fixed a minor compilation warning.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 15:53  sam

   * ./include/vlc_common.h: we don't set _() and N_() in Gnome-enabled modules
     because <gnome.h> already does it for us.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 15:10  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/svgalib.c: SVGAlib video output module.

     Currently only supports 256 color output, and defaults to 320x200. You need     to be root to use it, it may leave your console in an unusable state, lock
     up your video card, it will segfault at exit if you compile it as a plugin
     because of SVGAlib's ludicrous use of atexit() and signal().
     Apart from these few glitches, it's rather OK, use "-I dummy -V svgalib"
     to activate. Q or Esc to quit (press for a long time if it doesn't work).

2002-08-21 Wednesday 11:07  xav

 Fixed a polioterie in the previous commit

2002-08-21 Wednesday 09:27  sam

   * ./modules/codec/a52old/a52old.c: ported the old A52 decoder to aout3.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/s16tofloat32.c: converter needed for
     a52old, includes the walken trick and b_in_place = true.

2002-08-21 Wednesday 09:26  xav

 * libvlc.c : Win32 compilation fix.
 * modules.c : we now check the directory plugins/ to find some plugins.
 (this will allow us to use the packager / installer which wasn't aware
 of plugins -> modules :)

2002-08-20 Tuesday 22:11  stef

 *Set output format to AOUT_FMT_SPDIF when in spdif mode.

 S/PDIF does not work here in oss though (output starving).

2002-08-20 Tuesday 21:10  sam

   * ./modules/gui/gtk/display.c: changed the configuration callbacks so that
     all instances of a module get changed when options such as gtk-tooltips
     or gnome-toolbartext are toggled.

2002-08-20 Tuesday 21:02  sam

   * ./modules/gui/qnx/*: ported the QNX audio output to the new API, courtesy
     of Pascal Levesque.

2002-08-20 Tuesday 18:25  sam

   (compilation fixes for my previous commit)

2002-08-20 Tuesday 18:08  sam

   * ./modules/misc/gtk_main.c: created the gtk_main module, which simply runs
     gtk_main() in its own thread, and does nothing on subsequent calls. This
     ensures that gtk_main is only running once.
   * ./modules/gui/familiar/*, modules/gui/gtk/*: the familiar, gtk and gnome
     modules are now fully reentrant thanks to their use of the gtk_main module.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: implemented vlc_set(), a wrapper for config_Put* available
     to external programs.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: removed vlc_stop() and vlc_end(), everything is now done
     by vlc_destroy().
   * ./modules/control/rc/rc.c: implemented a few new functions. For instance,
     run "vlc -I rc" and then type "intf gtk" or "intf gnome". You can even
     launch several of them. "segfault" works, too.

2002-08-20 Tuesday 12:32  sam

   * ./modules/gui/familiar/familiar.c: added a timer to check when the
     familiar interface is asked to quit.

2002-08-19 Monday 23:12  massiot

 More changes in the date handling. Should be more tolerant with
 pause/play and change of audio channel.

2002-08-19 Monday 23:07  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/*: ported the ALSA, aRts, esd and OSS modules to
     the latest aout3 changes.

2002-08-19 Monday 21:54  massiot

 * Fixed BeOS output ;
 * Fixed a few boolean_t.

2002-08-19 Monday 21:31  massiot

 * ./configure: Fixed double detection of gethostbyname.
 * Major changes in the handling of dates in the audio output ; still buggy,
 but differently.
 * Fixed a major bug in the aout pre-filters, preventing to run any other
 decoder than liba52.
 * p_aout->output.pf_play now has only one argument.

2002-08-19 Monday 17:07  bozo

   * modules/audio_output/alsa.c: we now open the device in SetFormat because
     it depends on the audio format. Cosmetic changes. The S/PDIF output may
     work.

2002-08-19 Monday 11:51  tcastley

 Fixed segfault.  Now fails to load due to incorrect format.
 Getting there :)

2002-08-19 Monday 11:37  sam

   * ./src/misc/cpu.c: we use void(*)(int) instead of sighandler_t because
     mingw32 doesn't know about sighandler_t.

2002-08-19 Monday 11:13  sam

   * ./src/misc/cpu.c: libvlc now plays nice with SIGILL and restores the
     signal handler to its previous value after use.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: moved signal handling to vlc.c.

2002-08-19 Monday 08:30  sam

   * ./modules/visualization/xosd/xosd.c: support for libxosd 1.0.0.
   * ./configure.in: added check for libxosd version.

2002-08-19 Monday 08:19  gbazin

 * modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: fixed a bug related to the size of the
 fullscreen window. We also unmap the current window when switching to fullscreen.

2002-08-18 Sunday 20:36  jpsaman

 - File and directory listing show unix permissions.

2002-08-18 Sunday 16:17  titer

 Enhanced BeOS icon ;)

2002-08-18 Sunday 14:33  sigmunau

 removed a line used during debugging

2002-08-18 Sunday 14:11  sigmunau

  the mp3 demux now parses id3 tags into the info structures if libid3tag
 is available

2002-08-18 Sunday 13:49  sam

   * ./src/libvlc.c: removed the simple signal handler because it's not
     really needed, and we were calling pthread_mutex_lock from it.
   * ./src/libvlc.c: released a vlc_list_t that caused vlc --list to hang.

2002-08-18 Sunday 13:16  sigmunau

 doxygen documented my code

2002-08-18 Sunday 13:14  sigmunau

  modules/gui/kde/interface.cpp: made the kde interface look for the rc
 file in DATA_PATH
  modules/gui/kde/kde.cpp and interface.h: removed a stupid class, moved
 stuff from open() to run() to make the kde interface start without
 segfaults.

2002-08-18 Sunday 11:32  titer

 Fixed a few linking BeOS problems (-lm, -lstdc++.r4...).

 Now everything should compile with every gcc with no problem (mp4, ffmpeg
 and faad plugins, especially).

2002-08-17 Saturday 15:35  fenrir

  * all : mpeg_audio decoder works now with aout3.

2002-08-17 Saturday 13:33  jpsaman

 Added filetype information.

2002-08-17 Saturday 13:26  tcastley

 This now compiles in BeOS.  Probably others, the i was not declared.

2002-08-17 Saturday 08:46  tcastley

 At least it compiles now.  :-)

2002-08-16 Friday 16:26  sam

   * ./modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: we include Xmd.h before dpms.h
     (compilation fix for Solaris).

2002-08-16 Friday 14:30  bozo

 Up to date ALSA information.

2002-08-16 Friday 12:31  sam

   * ./src/playlist/playlist.c: added -Z (--random) for endless random playing.

2002-08-16 Friday 03:07  sam

   * ./modules/codec/spudec/*: split spudec into the parsing and the rendering
     functions.
   * ./modules/demux/mpeg/audio.c: at least three PS startcodes are required
     before we abort the parsing and consider the input as PS instead of MP3.

2002-08-15 Thursday 17:05  titer

 * Another BeOS fix for people using some recent gcc
    (that needs libstdc++.r4)

2002-08-15 Thursday 16:37  titer

  * BeOS fixes

2002-08-15 Thursday 12:35  bozo

   * configure.in, configure: put back the ALSA audio output module in
     configure.

2002-08-15 Thursday 12:22  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: compilation fix.
   * ./modules/gui/win32/preferences.cpp: the Win32 interface doesn't use the
     old module linked list anymore.

2002-08-15 Thursday 12:11  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: the module linked list is going bye bye. We now use
     the vlc_object_* and vlc_list_* functions to manage modules. The Win32
     interface doesn't build, but I'll fix this.

2002-08-15 Thursday 10:31  bozo

   * modules/audio_output/alsa.c: cleanings and comments.

 TODO: S/PDIF mode.

2002-08-15 Thursday 08:24  ipkiss

  * compilation fix

2002-08-14 Wednesday 21:50  jpsaman

 Changes in familiar interface:
 - added GtkCList instead of GtkList.
 - added first column sorting order by clicking on column header
 - selecting item from list works
 - reading entire directory list is displayed in GtkCList widget

2002-08-14 Wednesday 17:06  sam

   * ./src/misc/objects.c: implemented vlc_list_find() which works like
     vlc_object_find() but returns a list of _all_ the matching objects. Only
     works with FIND_ANYWHERE at the moment.
   * ./modules/gui/gtk/preferences.c, ./modules/gui/kde/preferences.cpp,
     ./modules/gui/win32/preferences.cpp: the module lists in the preferences
     menus work again.
   * ./src/misc/objects.c: added a missing sizeof that caused crashes because
     the reindexing of the global object array was incomplete.
   * ./include/modules_inner.h: propagated the module long description to its
     submodules.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 13:10  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/esd.c: compilation fix (aout_FormatTo is obsolete).
   * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c, ./src/audio_output/mixer.c: fixed a
     horrible sound issue by making sure internal buffers have a size multiple
     of 4 bytes. Waiting for a real fix made in Meuuh, of course.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 10:50  bozo

 ALSA audio output v3.01 is out !

2002-08-14 Wednesday 10:18  ipkiss

  * compilation fix (by sam)

2002-08-14 Wednesday 08:50  tooney

   . Simple RTP access module : only supports TS payload.
     This first draft is made to read RTP streamed by the vls.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 08:17  sam

   * ./modules/control/rc/rc.c: 'l' outputs a list of all allocated objects,
     just as 'd' displayed a tree of attached objects.
   * ./src/misc/modules.c: added a missing header.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 00:43  massiot

 * Added a third argument to aout_OutputNextBuffer. In case the buffer
   received does not start exactly at the given date, it indicates if the
   output plug-in is able to compensate for the drift (for instance on
   startup, or with S/PDIF packets), or if we need the aout core to
   resample the coming buffers. It is currently unimplemented.

2002-08-14 Wednesday 00:23  massiot

 * Changed aout_FormatTo* ; aout_FormatToSize does no longer exist.
   p_buffer now has a i_nb_bytes member. It is possible to indicate for a
   format its byterate (necessary for AC3 and SPDIF).
 * S/PDIF output seems to be working at last (tested with the file output).

2002-08-13 Tuesday 22:42  massiot

 * New float32to* converter modules, courtesy of Xavier Maillard
   <zedek@fxgsproject.org>.
 * Fixed a bug in float32tos16, where gcc over-optimized a little and
   caused problems on some platforms (eg. solaris).

2002-08-13 Tuesday 20:28  fenrir

  * clean up some code, add "mp3" short cut.
    And now if this demux has been forced it will (try) to play the whole
 file even if the stream is heavily corrupted (like PS demux).
    But now, it makes less assumptions on the stream, so report any
 problem if it mis-recognizes others files as mpeg audio (specially PS file).

2002-08-13 Tuesday 16:11  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/arts.c: ported the aRts module to aout3.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/*: fixed a bug in all the converters
     test routines (thx Meuuh).

2002-08-13 Tuesday 14:53  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/esd.c: we now properly use the esd_get_latency()
     return value to avoid audio starvation.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/*: a little loop optimization trick.
   * ./src/audio_output/aout_ext-dec.c: removed this deprecated file.

2002-08-13 Tuesday 13:15  sigmunau

 ./modules/control/rc/rc.c: fixed a segfault when pressing 'i' with no
 input

2002-08-13 Tuesday 11:59  sam

   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: we spare a variable by using p_aout->b_die
     instead of our own variable.
   * ./modules/audio_filter/converter/a52tospdif.c, ./modules/codec/a52.c: added
     <unistd.h>, required for bswap.
   * ./modules/demux/mp4/libmp4.c: removed an unneccessary semicolon in a
     macro definition.
   * ./modules/audio_output/esd.c: first attempt at getting esd to work.
   * ./modules/video_output/*: split sdl.so into a video and an audio plugin,
     and removed useless subdirectories.
   * ./modules/audio_output/sdl.c: compilation fix.

2002-08-12 Monday 22:48  massiot

 * Fixed miscellaneous bugs.
 * Fixed an endianness issue in S/PDIF.
 * Added a walken optimization of float32tos16.

2002-08-12 Monday 22:30  sigmunau

  ./modules/demux/mpeg/ps.c: this module never fails the probe and should
 therefore have capability 0

2002-08-12 Monday 22:12  massiot

 * Fixed a variable overflow bug in the audio output.
 * Prepared for some advances in the aout3 clock management.
 * Added the first stone of the forthcoming stream output.

2002-08-12 Monday 21:43  sigmunau

  ./configure.in: fix linking of i420_rgb

2002-08-12 Monday 21:40  jpsaman

 This conversion should make more sense.

2002-08-12 Monday 20:43  jpsaman

 - Updated configure to build fixed32tos16 and fixed32tofloat32.
   Desperately need a fixed32 mixer for testing the conversions.
 - Uncommented unused functions in libmad.

2002-08-12 Monday 20:38  jpsaman

 Support for browsing local media (not finished).

2002-08-12 Monday 20:35  jpsaman

 Updated Makefile to include fixed32tos16 and fixed32tofloat32 conversions.

2002-08-12 Monday 20:35  jpsaman

 Added fixed32tofloat32 conversion.

2002-08-12 Monday 20:34  jpsaman

 Added fixed32tos16 filter based upon libmad downscale functionality.

2002-08-12 Monday 17:38  sigmunau

  ALL: added GPL headers to my files. Some of the files from the original
 author does still not contain this header.

2002-08-12 Monday 17:00  fenrir

  * all : enable aac demux by default.

2002-08-12 Monday 16:59  fenrir

  * all : a demux for aac stream ( raw aac with adts headers ). For now
 it has a capability equal to 0 because it conflicts with PS, so you need
 to force it.

2002-08-12 Monday 15:56  sigmunau

   ./Doxyfile: a sample doxygen configuration file. Have a look at
 http://s253c.studby.ntnu.no/vlc/html/index.html to see what doxygen can
 do.

   ./doc/doxygen: a place for doxygen to put it's files

2002-08-12 Monday 09:34  sam

   * ./src/misc/objects.c: two big changes in the object API: now objects can
     only have one parent, because I don't want to deal with cycles, and each
     created object is indexed in a global array. This feature is unused yet,
     but it will speed up vlc_object_find(FIND_ANYWHERE).
   * ./debian/rules: activated the faad codec.
   * ./doc/fortunes.txt: new fortune cookies.
   * ./modules/codec/mpeg_video/headers.c: reduced the use of attach/detach.
   * ./modules/audio_output/oss.c: fixed two compilation warnings.

2002-08-11 Sunday 12:27  sam

   * ./modules/misc/memcpy/memcpyaltivec.c: added a missing AltiVec requirement.

2002-08-11 Sunday 08:30  gbazin

 * src/misc/configuration.c: bugfix (don't initialize and free p_module->object_lock
 twice).
 * src/misc/win32_specific.c: missing initializations.
 * modules/demux/mp4/libmp4.c: was missing an #ifdef HAVE_ZLIB_H

2002-08-11 Sunday 01:27  massiot

 More S/PDIF fixes.

 * modules/video_output/directx/aout.c: adapted the directx audio plugin to aout3.
 * modules/audio_output/waveout.c: adapted the waveout audio plugin to aout3 and
 decreased its score so the directx plugin is selected by default.

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: max recursion level is now 5.
   * ./modules/access/dvdplay/es.c: fixed a buffer overflow.

2002-08-06 Tuesday 23:43  jlj

   * ./modules/gui/macosx/open.m: compile fix

2002-08-06 Tuesday 20:04  massiot

 Removed the MODULES file, because on case-insensitive filesystems, it
 conflicts with the modules/ directory.

2002-08-06 Tuesday 19:31  jpsaman

 Sam I hate you ;-)

2002-08-06 Tuesday 10:54  tcastley

 Fixed include call.  Now compiles and BeOS version runs :)

2002-08-06 Tuesday 00:26  sam

   * ./Makefile, ./mozilla/Makefile: make uninstall removes vlc-specific dirs.
   * ./src/misc/modules.c: the directory browsing should be more portable now,
     we use stat(2) instead of file->d_type.

  * add compilation of postprocessing modules for ffmpeg.

2002-08-04 Sunday 22:13  fenrir

  * add post processing modules.( As defined in MPEG4 ISO) There are C,
 mmx, mmxext version, but only mmxext is really usable (other need a
  _lot_ of CPU power).

 There are new options for ffmpeg plugins :
  --ffmpeg-pp to choose postprocessing module( c, mmx, mmext or mmx2 )
  --ffmpeg-pp-q to choose quality( 0..6 )
  --ffmpeg-db-?? ( where first ? is for y or c, and the other ? for v or h )
 to force deblocking on luminance(y)/chrominance(c) horizontally or
 vertically.
  --ffmpeg-dr-? ( where ? is y or c ) to force dering on ...

   * ./modules/*: moved plugins to the new tree. Yet untested builds include
     waveout, directx, qnx, beos, win32, macosx, and the AltiVec modules.
   * ALL: removed mention of AC3 in favour of A52.
   * ./configure.in, ./Makefile*: modules can now be built deeper than 1
     directory. As a consequence, the build is even slower (but I'm fixing
     this) and make clean doesn't work anymore.

2002-08-04 Sunday 12:18  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: we now recursively parse directories when
     looking for plugins.

2002-08-04 Sunday 08:45  sam

 *first version of plugin for libdvdplay. To test it, you need to have
  libdvdplay installed (available from videolan CVS), and request plugins
 compilation in the usual way:
 	--enable-dvdplay.
 Note that libdvdplay needs libdvdread and libdvdcss.

 Currently it has only been tested under linux, with gnome interface (optional)
 and xvideo output.

 What works (more or less):
  -DVD reading in some rare cases :) (title and menus),
  -Menu pause,
  -Seeking,
  -Selecting directly a specific title/chapter/angle,
  -Changing audio, sub-picture, angle during playback,
  -Interactive menus with mouse only.

 What is missing:
  -Menu buttons highlighting (needs spudec patch),
  -Keyboard interaction (needs a specific part in port specific plugins),
  -A specific interface to navigate through menus (needs that I move my ass),
  -Interactive menus won't work with other output plugins so long as they
   have not been patched to send mouse/keyboard events to vlc interface,
  -Whatever you need.

 Known bugs (bugs in libdvdplay mostly):
  -Seeking in some menus or intro titles (bad vobu map),
  -Read/seek error with some DVDs,
  -the configure needs tweaking,
  -numerous segfaults,
  -decoder/output modules locking error,
  -fuzzy colors in menus when spudec is active (default in menus).

 The plugin is not guaranteed to work anywhere outside my computer. If it break your, don't come and complain to me :).

   * ALL: decoders now use a fourcc as a probe value.
   * include/input_ext-intf.h: killed p_es->b_audio, since i_cat already fills
     its purpose.
   * include/input_ext-intf.h: killed p_es->i_type in favour of p_es->i_fourcc.
   * include/video.h: killed p_pic->p_plane->b_margin; now i_visible_pitch is
     always valid.

   * ./src/libvlc.h: replaced --mpeg-adec and --ac3-adec with --codec; see
     vlc --help for more information.

   * include/video.h: removed fourcc values which should _not_ be global
     (thanks fenrir for convincing me).
   * ALL: video output plugins use the VLC_FOURCC macro to build their fourccs.
   * ./plugins/beos/InterfaceWindow.cpp: removed the last remaining call to
     input_ChangeES.

    Things I'm not sure about and need comments:
     - I used "mpga" and "mpgv" for MPEG (1+2) audio and video fourcc values.
     - I also introduced "spu ", "lpcm" and "ac3 ".
     - I removed for instance "MP4_GetCodec" because it wasn't really
       used except for the description string. I hope this change did not
       break anything really important.
     - fenrir, I must have broken a lot of things you wrote. Sorry in advance.

2002-07-23 Tuesday 00:30  sam

   * ./src/input/input_info.c, ./src/misc/messages.c: initialized the first
     vasprintf arguments to NULL for extra safety.

2002-07-22 Monday 22:19  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: added the "any" and "none" keywords to the module
     selection string. "any" matches any module, and "none" always fails.

     You can for instance use "--vout none" to disable video output, or
     "--intf gtk,any" to use the gtk interface or any other one if gtk isn't
     available. Hope it's clear :)

 to the others which can't avoid a flood from the input module.

   * ALL: the first libvlc commit.

    As for video output 4, this breaks almost everything, but I'll slowly
   do what remains to be fixed during the weekend.

    Changes in vlc:
    ===============

   * vlc is now a very small program (20 lines) which uses the libvlc API;
    it is quite simple for the moment but can be extended in the future.

   * interfaces, decoders, video outputs, etc. are now almost the same
    objects (yes, I know, this is C++ redone in C) and are structured in
    a tree. More about this later, but basically it allows the following
    nice features:
     - several interfaces
     - several playlists with several outputs
     - input plugins spawning helper interfaces (will be used for DVD menus)
     - anything spawning anything; I swear there are useful uses for this!

   * libvlc can be used in other programs; I'm currently writing a Mozilla
    plugin for my employer.

    Things currently broken:
    ========================

   * most interfaces, most ports
   * the playlist handling (almost finished rewriting this though). This means
    no file can be played from the GUI, you need to use the commandline. This
    also means it segfaults at EOF, when exiting the program, and it sometimes
    refuses to open a file when asked to.

2002-06-01 Saturday 11:38  sam

   * Backported fixes from MAIN.

 "foo" boolean config option is defined.
 * modified the help menu to indicate if the option is enabled or
 disabled by default.

2002-05-29 Wednesday 18:39  sam

   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: when the video output hasn't received
     a new picture for a while, it redisplays the last displayed one. This will
     be useful for DVD menus, but also solves the "picture becomes black when
     vlc is paused" issue.

 * ./include/inpu_ext-dec.h added a check to fifo->b_die after the call
 to BitstreamNextDataPacket() in GetChunk().
 Code using GetChunk() also needs to check fifo->b_die before using the
 obtained data.
 This fixes frequent crashes you get on win32 with the a52 plugin when you
 close a stream.

 * ./src/misc/modules.c: restored plugins hiding as the problem is fixed.
 * ./plugins/directx/directx.c: UnregisterClass() in MODULE_DEACTIVATE. If
    we don't do this, trying to use the class when the plugin is reloaded will
    cause a segfault.

 PS: on Win32 the sdl plugin is still affected by this. It looks like SDL keeps
     an internal state which isn't updated when we reload the plugin.

2002-05-22 Wednesday 17:19  sam

 * First try for IPv6 support on Win32. This hasn't been tested so it
   might not work! To compile this stuff you need a mingw compiler with
   w32api-1.3.

 The win32 code uses the getaddrinfo function because inet_pton is
 supposed to be deprecated and not supported by Microsoft. gethostbyname2
 isn't supported as well. Maybe we could try to unify the ipv6 plugin and
 have all the ports use getaddrinfo ? (I didn't dare to do it because I
 don't want to break anything before a release ;-)

2002-05-20 Monday 19:34  sam

   * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: workaround for a bug in the dummy vout.

2002-05-20 Monday 14:22  sam

   * ./ChangeLog: updated changelog.

2002-05-20 Monday 14:12  sam

   * ./Makefile.opts.in: removed configuration stuff which does not need to
     rebuild anything to Makefile.config, so that editing it will not cause
     a complete rebuild.

2002-05-19 Sunday 23:51  massiot

 Mac OS X-specific :
 * We now use real-time threads ;

 * updated MSVC++ project.
 * small corrections to the LONGTEXT descriptions in main.c.

2002-05-19 Sunday 12:12  massiot

 Updated long descriptions.

2002-05-19 Sunday 09:37  gbazin

 * moved the mpeg-motion and mpeg-idct options to the mpeg_vdec plugin
 * added a few *_LONGTEXT descriptions to main.c
 * on win32 DVD/VCD_DEVICE defaults to to D:

 Could anyone finish the *_LONGTEXT descriptions in main.c. There aren't
 that many left right now, just the ones I didn't really know what to do
 with.
 If someone also wants to review and change the already existing
 *_LONGTEXT descriptions, he is welcome as well because there are not
 really high quality descriptions :(

2002-05-19 Sunday 00:43  massiot

 * Another addition.

2002-05-19 Sunday 00:34  massiot

 * Desperate attempt to improve audio output ;

   Bossoreille de Ribou <bozo@via.ecp.fr>

2002-05-18 Saturday 17:47  sam

   * ALL: changed __inline__ with inline (autoconf does the job for us anyway,
     and mipspro doesn't know about __inline__).

2002-05-18 Saturday 15:51  gbazin

 * fixed deadlock in NextFrame() in aout_pcm.c

2002-05-18 Saturday 14:03  gbazin

 * updated the MSVC++ project files and added support for dirent (vlc compiled
    with msvc can now load plugins - even compiled with mingw).
 * small portability fixes.

2002-05-18 Saturday 13:33  massiot

 * Menu item to maximize the volume in Mac OS X ;
 * Dropped dependancy on autoconf 2.52.

2002-05-18 Saturday 13:30  gbazin

 * modified the directx video plugin to try to create an YUV surface before
    falling back to an RGB surface when it's not possible to use overlays.
    Some graphic cards can do the YUV->RGB conversion in hardware during the
    blitting stage.
 * in the directx video plugin, we now request that the RGB surface be created
    in video memory. The reasoning behind this is that usually surfaces in
    video memory benefit from more hardware acceleration (like for instance
    hw rescaling, hw blitting, etc...)
 * added two options to the directx video plugin to disable the above features.
    (mainly because my video driver is buggy and doesn't handle them well).

 * small cosmetic changes to the generation of the config file.

 * fix for config_GetHomeDir() on win32. SHGetFolderPath() is located in
    shfolder.dll not shell32.dll.
 * fix for the gtk preferences dialog box. To be sure that an int or float value
    is actually changed we call gtk_spin_button_update() in the
    GtkInt/FloatChanged() event handler.

2002-05-18 Saturday 11:59  sam

   * ./debian/control: made the Build-Depends: entry a one-liner (Closes
     Debian bug #147103).

2002-05-18 Saturday 08:50  stef

 *A lock was not released;

2002-05-17 Friday 18:06  stef

 *Don't keep the control lock during the pause

2002-05-17 Friday 18:01  stef

 *check for b_die and b_error in all loops so that we don't remain stuck
 waiting for data whereas the vlc has tried to quit.

2002-05-17 Friday 16:38  sam

   * ./src/misc/mtime.c: we use nanosleep whenever possible (patch from Meuuh).

 * src/input/input_programs.c: fixed memory corruption by setting a few
     pointers to NULL after they have been free()ed.
 * src/input/input_programs.c: removed now useless ASSERTs.

 This patch comes from sam, so if you want to blame someone blame him ;-)

2002-05-15 Wednesday 15:46  asmax

 - check size to avoid realloc(0)

2002-05-15 Wednesday 13:36  marcari

   * removed a debug message that I forgot in my previous commit

2002-05-15 Wednesday 13:07  marcari

 On sam's advice I added the input_FDNetworkClose() function to be called
 when closing a  networking stream instead of input_FDClose().  It is due
 to WIN32  because we have  to call  closesocket() instead of  close() to
 close the socket. The problem was  : windows did not leave the multicast
 group when closing the socket.

   * input_ext-plugins.c : where is located the function
   * *.h : function declaration
   * udp.c, http.c : these modules now call input_FDNetworkClose()

2002-05-15 Wednesday 11:06  marcari

   * netutils.c: use closesocket() instead of close() at the end
   of the network_ChannelJoin() for WIN32.

   It closes the following bug : when changing channel we sometimes got
   a 'no answer from vlcs' even if the answer is sent back.

2002-05-15 Wednesday 01:29  sam

   * ./src/misc/configuration.c: fixed an issue with long options from
     modules where option arguments and playlist entries were mixed.

2002-05-15 Wednesday 00:04  sam

 It should now be possible to quit when reading a bogus file.

2002-05-14 Tuesday 19:47  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: if a module has a zero-scored capability, we don't
     try to use it, unless it was explicitely requested (--vout for example).

2002-05-14 Tuesday 19:33  bozo

   * src/misc/iso-639.def, include/iso_lang.h, src/misc/iso_lang.c: iso-839-[12] tools.

     * Makefile configure.in : to compile it

2002-05-09 Thursday 21:24  sam

   * ./src/interface/main.c: if Ctrl-C doesn't kill vlc cleanly for any
     reason, user just needs to hit Ctrl-C again 1 second later and we'll
     exit disgustingly instead of freezing.

2002-05-09 Thursday 14:52  jobi

 Improvements of the OS X GUI.

2002-05-06 Monday 21:05  gbazin

 * video plugins that don't handle rescaling themselves have to let the
   video_output thread know about resizing events (with VOUT_SIZE_CHANGE event).
   (this part needs some clean-up but it is basically working for the X11 and
    SDL plugins).

 * fixed fullscreen for the SDL plugin.

 * xmga and sdl now switch to fullscreen on double-click.

2002-05-05 Sunday 08:25  gbazin

 * fixed the resizing and scaling of the X11 video output.
 * clicking on the video doesn't pause it anymore (use spacebar for this), but
   double-clicking will now switch between fullscreen and window mode.

2002-05-04 Saturday 15:49  sam

   * ./plugins/network/ipv4.c: fixed ipv4.so compilation under QNX.
   * ./configure.in: deactivated ipv6.so under QNX for now.

2002-05-04 Saturday 03:36  lool

   * ./BUGS :
     - no text in the status bar with gtk intf
     - no window title in gtk intf on some machines, correct title on another

2002-05-03 Friday 20:49  sam

   * ./include/modules_inner.h, ./src/misc/configuration.c: support for config
     options callbacks.

     They don't take any argument for the moment, but this will change when
     I'm finished with my other vlc changes. There is a little problem: the
     Gtk+ interface keeps calling Put***Variable each time we click on "Apply"
     or "Save". I think it should only call it once. Is there a way to fix
     this? Gildas? lool? :-)

2002-05-03 Friday 18:40  sam

   * ./configure.in: we check support for variadic macros (screw Borland!).

2002-05-02 Thursday 23:06  massiot

 Small FAQ update. Please note that everyone can update this FAQ if they

 * Misc sound fixes [Mac OS X port]
 * Fixed VCD double detection

2002-05-01 Wednesday 21:31  gbazin

 * The configuration file and the log file are opened in text mode. This mode
 should only have a meaning on Win32 and isn't supposed to break any other
 platform. If does give you any trouble then shout.

2002-05-01 Wednesday 19:59  gbazin

 * added a --with-a52-tree option to the configure script.

2002-04-30 Tuesday 12:56  gbazin

 * added config_Get/PutFloatVariable to p_sysmbols. Thanks to Sigmund Augdal
 for pointing this bug out.
 * on Win32 the aout_pcm thread is given a high priority. This helps avoiding
 lots of audio underruns, especially when moving around the video window.

2002-04-29 Monday 23:57  massiot

 Cosmetic fixes.

2002-04-29 Monday 21:22  gbazin

 * Restored vout_CopyPicture(). It is needed by the directx plugin damnit ;-)
 * Restored AOUT_BUFFER_DURATION to its old value. It should solve quite a few
     underrun problems.
 * A little bit of DirectX plugin clean-up.

 * fixed the --with-gtk-config-path and --with-sdl-config-path options in
    configure.in

2002-04-27 Saturday 02:20  jobi

     function did not make sense here.
   * ./include/video.h: moved vout_ChromaCmp out of the way.
   * ./plugins/avi/fourcc.h, ./include/video.h: merged these two files into

     safer variants $with_foo and $enable_foo.

2002-04-25 Thursday 02:10  jobi

 * Moved Program Specific Information decoder to the ts demux module
 * Added a mpeg_ts_dvbpsi module tha uses libdvbpsi to decode PSIs. It is

2002-04-24 Wednesday 23:08  gbazin

 * on Win32 the config file is now stored under the "Application Data" folder
   belonging to the user. (this works if at least IE4 is installed, otherwise

   * ./src/interface/main.c: tidied the help output code.
   * ALL: removed underscores from option names and made a few options more
     self-explanatory, for instance --input_channel becomes --audio-channel;
     run vlc -H to see what has changed.

     verbose messages.
   * ./po/en_GB.po: British translation.

2002-04-21 Sunday 21:29  gbazin

   they should and they also are cumulative (using -vv --warning=3 you end up
   with i_warning_level=5)

2002-04-21 Sunday 18:32  sam

   * ./src/misc/configuration.c: support for short options. -V, -A, -I
     are back, and we also have -4 and -6 for IPv4/IPv6.

2002-04-05 Friday 20:44  sam

   * ./plugins/win32/win32.cpp: fixed `--intf intfwin' which wasn't working.
   * ./Makefile: we don't include the Gtk+ and SDL DLLs in the win32 package
     anymore, the package is now 700k instead of 4MB.
   * ./configure.in, ./Makefile, ./Makefile.opts.in: replaced LIB_FOO with
     foo_LDFLAGS and CFLAGS_BAR with bar_CFLAGS for faster builds, and moved a
     lot of stuff from Makefile.opts.in back to configure.in.
   * ./install-win32: updated script for NSIS 1.96.

    I hope this doesn't break too many other architectures...

2002-04-05 Friday 12:35  sam

   * ./configure.in: added --enable-intfwin to enable the win32 interface and
     --with-bcbuilder to tell make where to find Borland C++ Builder.

2002-04-05 Friday 03:27  sam

   * ./plugins/win32/intfwin.bpr: we now build intfwin.so at the right place.
   * ./plugins/win32/Makefile: intfwin.so can be built using commandline.
   * ./configure.in, ./include/threads.h, ./include/common.h: a custom defs.h
     file isn't needed for the intfwin plugin anymore.
   * ./INSTALL.win32: updated compilation instructions for the intfwin plugin.

2002-04-05 Friday 01:05  gbazin

 * introduced a memalign wrapper that will align the memory manually if
   memalign doesn't exist.

   void *vlc_memalign( size_t align, size_t size, void **pp_orig )
   where the return value is the aligned pointer and *pp_orig is the pointer
   that has to be freed afterwards.

   the arithmetic I'm doing on the pointer to align it is not portable to
   64bits architectures. If someone knows how to something portable, please
   tell me ( and no I don't want to do if(sizeof(void *) == blabla) ).

   Other little problem, I was planning to use posix_memalign by default in
   the wrapper implementation but it doesn't work (someone can tell me what
   I'm doing wrong ?)

 * re-enabled the sse plugins on win32 as we don't have anymore alignment
   issues.

 * fixed typo in vout_directx.c

2002-04-04 Thursday 22:51  massiot

     "VideoLAN Team" entry.

2002-04-04 Thursday 15:35  sam

   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.glade, plugins/gtk/gnome.glade, ./plugins/kde/kde.cpp:
     replaced the outdated author list with a "VideoLAN Team" entry.
   * ./debian/rules, ./debian/control: deactivated the vlc-kde package because
     it does not work, and removed the vlc-a52 package because liba52 is
     statically linked into vlc.
   * ./debian/control: added more helpful package descriptions.
   * ALL: changed version to 0.3.0. Yeah, it's coming.
   * ./Makefile: fixed make dist.

   * ./configure.in: added (hopefully) explicit messages on how to get
     libdvdcss and link vlc with it.
   * ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: removed inclusion of dvd_udf.h.

2002-04-03 Wednesday 06:45  sam

   * ./plugins/ogg/*: added preliminary files for an Ogg/Vorbis decoder a
     contributor is currently working on.

   instead of the now inexistant DVD_DEVICE macro.

2002-04-03 Wednesday 02:43  sam

   * ./po/ja.po: added Japanese translation from Fumio Nakayama
     <endymion@ca2.so-net.ne.jp>.
   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_callbacks.c: fixed disc ejection code.
   * ./ChangeLog: how about a nice cup of 870 lines of ChangeLog for the 0.3.0
     release?

2002-04-02 Tuesday 23:43  gbazin

 * New pthread implementation for WinNT/2K/XP. This implementation shouldn't
   be subject to race conditions as it is using SignalObjectAndWait() from the
   Win32 API.
   As this should be somehow slower than the old method (still used on Win9x),
   you can specify that you want to use the old method with the "fast_pthread"
   config option.

 * Added a new p_main_sys global variable. This variable is a pointer to an
   OS specific structure which is defined in *_specific.h. This structure can
   be filled by the already existing System_Init() function and is a nice
   way to avoid too many #ifdefs.

2002-04-02 Tuesday 23:27  gbazin

 * Got rid of the DVD_DEVICE macro. We now use the dvd_device config option.
   ( this creates a small memory leak as we don't free the string obtained
     from config_GetPszVariable, but I think we can live with it for now )

 * the SSE plugins are disable on the mingw32 build as they don't work.
   ( because memalign is not implemented on win32, and malloc only aligns
     on an 8 bytes boundary )

 * fixed small mistake in INSTALL.win32

2002-04-02 Tuesday 23:22  ipkiss

  * ./include/config.h: fixed config directory name for windows
  * ./plugins/win32: the network dialog now respects the preferences settings

 faster)

2002-04-02 Tuesday 21:56  ipkiss

 * ./src/interface/main.c: check that channels have been created before
   the call to network_ChannelJoin

2002-04-02 Tuesday 11:31  ipkiss

  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: small compilation fix

2002-04-02 Tuesday 10:43  tcastley

 not of any practical use.

2002-03-28 Thursday 21:21  massiot

 Fix for sparc.

2002-03-28 Thursday 10:17  gbazin

 * don't try to stat() the dvd drive letter on win32
 * disabled YUV overlay double buffering for now, as it seems to actually be
     slower.
 * temporary fix in vlc_cond_signal() for win32 (I really should use
     SignalObjectAndWait() on WinNT so we can avoid race conditions in the
     pthread code). This fixes a problem noticed on WinXP where vlc would
     freeze regularly and eat-up all the CPU (fun no?)

2002-03-28 Thursday 03:53  jobi

 * When unselecting an ES, we must ged rid of p_es->p_pes so that it is
   regererated when we select this ES again. It made vlc segfault when
   switching from some stream to another, or when switching program
   in satellite input.

2002-03-27 Wednesday 22:15  massiot

 * UDP access plug-in can now receive MPTS (Multiple Program TS) and switch
 programs
 * Audio and video output go to time-constrained scheduling [OS X port]

 * various little portability fixes

2002-03-26 Tuesday 22:30  gbazin

 * modified the gtk interface to save an empty <string> option as a NULL pointer
 * modified config_LoadConfigFile to consider an empty <string> option as a
    NULL pointer.

2002-03-26 Tuesday 22:02  gbazin

 * changed the behaviour of the config file:
   - now all the config options are saved. <string> config options which have
   no default value are also saved in the config file but as an empty string.
   - config_LoadConfigFile will ignore empty config options, which also means
   we cannot pass an empty string as a <string> config option. (this shouldn't
   matter anyway)

2002-03-25 Monday 23:36  ipkiss

  * Added a win32 interface plugin, developed with Borland C++ Builder.
    To build the plugin, follow the instructions in INSTALL-win32.txt

  * Known bugs:
         - subtitles don't work
         - a crash occurs when the user exits by pressing 'q' in the vout
         - when moving the slider, position in the stream updates even if
           the slider isn't released yet

  * TODO list:
         - clean code in menu.cpp
         - adapt lool's enhancements of the Gtk+ preferences box
         - write drag-and-drop stuff
         - and of course, fix known bugs :)

  * For those of you who can't wait till the next release to test the win32
    interface, binary files are available here:
    http://www.via.ecp.fr/~ipkiss/intfwin/vlc.zip
    Enjoy!

 Miscellaneous fixes for the OS X port.

2002-03-21 Thursday 22:10  gbazin

 * the calculation for the initial video window dimensions is now done in
     video_output.c and made available into p_vout->i_window_height/width.
     This allows to get rid of duplicated code and unify the behaviour of
     the video output plugins. (not all the plugins have been modified
     because I didn't want to break anything).

     As a side effect, the --width and --height options are now working, you
     can even use only --width or only --height the other dimension will adapt
     automatically to the video characteristics.
     Note that you need to remove the width/height options from the config file
     or set them to -1 if you want to use the actual video size.

2002-03-21 Thursday 07:11  gbazin

 * moved GetConfigurationFromCmdLine() into configuration.c and renamed it
    into config_LoadCmdLine()
 * config_GetHomeDir doesn't use getpwuid_r anymore as this was creating
    some problems on solaris. This function now uses getpwuid and is called
    only once to store the home directory into the p_main structure.

2002-03-21 Thursday 02:27  jobi

 [no log message]

2002-03-20 Wednesday 23:00  gbazin

   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a segfault.

2002-03-17 Sunday 11:12  gbazin

 * small fix for the config file. The parser assumes that the config file is
 divided into sections (a section is the config data for a plugin and begins
 with something like [foo]), so the comment for the beginning of the section
 must be after the section marker and not before.

 If you want to illustrate the problem (without this fix):
 - save vlc's config
 - exit from vlc and remove for example the dsp plugin (rm plugins/dsp.so)
 - resave vlc's config
 and now look at the end of the config file, it's all screwed up.

2002-03-16 Saturday 23:03  sam

   * ./configure.in: more modules are plugins.
   * ./src/misc/configuration.c: changed ~/.VideoLan/vlc to ~/.videolan/vlcrc,
     and a few cosmetic changes (sorry Gildas for the butchery).
   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: C version of the I420 to RV15/16 chroma.

2002-03-16 Saturday 01:40  gbazin

 * This the last piece of the new configuration module. You can now save your
 configuration options (only from the gtk/gnome interface for now). The config
 file will be saved as ~/.VideoLan/vlc

 It's not quite yet finished (well there are a few small details to sort out),
 but I'm going away for the week-end and I wanted to commit this before so you
 can all have a play with it :)

2002-03-15 Friday 04:41  sam

   * ./Makefile: fixed OS X vlc.app compilation dependencies.
   * ./configure.in: fixed the endianness check under Solaris.

   * ./src/input/input.c: strings are now initialized to "" instead of NULL.

   * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: we now properly support the subtitle
     palette information we get from the DVD. Subtitles rox !
   * ./src/video_output/vout_subpictures.c: removed all DVD-specific routines
     and put them into spu_decoder.c.

2002-03-15 Friday 01:47  stef

 *Move iec958/spdif encapsulation from ac3_spdif to aout_spdif.
 It will eventually allows to use ac3_adec or a52 for spdif output.

 *Remove an ugly loop in aout_spdif.

2002-03-14 Thursday 01:35  stef

 *p_es->p_demux_data is available in p_config->p_demux_data so that the input
 can pass information directly to the decoder.

 *First application: aspect ratio for DVD is read from the ifo (should fix
 the buf with aspect ratio in anamorphic DVDs).

 *The DVD plugin also copy the spu yuv palette in p_demux_data so that the
 spudec can display subtitle with the right color (sam !).

 *Removed duplicate code and useless lock in gtk.

2002-03-13 Wednesday 08:41  tcastley

 Updated Tony Castley's e-mail.

2002-03-12 Tuesday 18:37  stef

 *New configuration option to choose audio output format at runtime.
 It allows to select spdif pass-through decoder with --ac3_adec and to
 remove the ugly b_ac3 in main.h

 As a consequence --spdif doesn't work anymore: you should use --ac3_adec pass

 *Fixed a typo in main.c

 *Return the option name in error message for unknown option intead of the
 argument.

2002-03-11 Monday 07:23  gbazin

 * New GTK configuration interface. This interface is generated dynamically
   at run-time from the configuration data contained in each plugin.
 * config_PutPszVariable and config_GetPszVariable are now thread safe.
 * Few modifications/optimizations to the config module.
 * Got rid of all the _VAR macros in config.h

 This is the first version of the GTK configuration interface. There are still
 a few raw corners and a fews things left to do, but it basically does what
 I wanted.
 Constructive comments like it sucks or it smells rotten fish are of course
 very welcome. And if there are GTK gurus out there, please don't hesitate to
 add your touch.

 I also started to add usefull comments to the configuration options but I'm not
 really good at this kind of thing so if people want to help, they can finish
 the job. For this look at all the *_LONGTEXT macros at the top of main.c

 (PS: Translations will also be appreciated but not right now as the interface
 will likely change again in the few coming days)

 *Fixed EOF segfault at end of DVD

 *Buffer manager is renintialised at area change.

2002-03-08 Friday 00:26  bozo

 Audio output ALSA: spdif support.

2002-03-06 Wednesday 23:54  sam

   * ./src/interface/main.c: disabled the GNOME segfault dialog in debug
     mode. We want nice, clean segfaults, with huge core files and a lot
     of rattle noise.

2002-03-06 Wednesday 03:27  sam

   * ./plugins/ac3_adec/ac3_parse.c: ac3dec is now less verbose.
   * ./src/interface/interface.c: fixed a deadlock when seeking the
     stream using the keyboard arrows.

2002-03-06 Wednesday 01:20  stef

 *Removed an occurance of former angle item in gtk.

 *Fixed a bug in ES management introduced lately in DVD/DvdRead.

 *Beginning of reorganisation in DVD plugin source files, in order to try to
 make it easier to understand. There is some work left though :p.

 *Decreased the score for VCD plugin, as the VCD demuxer was used even
 for DVD :p. It should make autodetection work.
 Some comment:
 -I think that VCDInit should make a test on the access plugin and be launched
 only if the access plugin is VCD,
 -VCDOpen shouldn't set p_input->b_error: if it fails we just try another
 module,
 -PSRead doesn't need to be duplicated anymore: input_ReadPS is now available
 for plugins (cf Christophe's commit).

 Please comment around that: I'd like to know if the behaviour I've described
 is the one everyone expects.

 Enjoy my new bugs :p

2002-03-05 Tuesday 23:29  jobi

 * Modified vcd input for the new input III.
 * Still have problems with end of tracks.
 * Modified the command line, as stef did for the DVD :

  [vcd:][device][@[title][,chapter]

  Note that chapter support is not yet implemented.

2002-03-05 Tuesday 17:46  stef

 * Dvd angle is now handled through a program structure, so that the interface
 needs nothing specific to change angle.

 * Fixed a bug in clock management where ES without a program couldn't get
 timestamped.

 *Fixed program management in gnome/gtk. Program now also appears in popup.

 *In interface, only display ES associated with the selected program, or with
 no program at all.

2002-03-05 Tuesday 06:48  gbazin

 * fixed typo in the win32 change to the input parser.

2002-03-04 Monday 23:56  massiot

 * IPv6 network module, courtesy of Alexis Guillard <alexis.guillard@bt.com>,
 for BT ;
 * --6 and --4 options to force IPv6 or IPv4 (FIXME: it should be -6 and
 -4 but I don't know how to do it with the new configuration module) ;
 * Channel manager now uses a socket from the network plug-in and is more
 portable (and probably broken, too :) ;
 * input_ReadPS and input_ReadTS are now in mpeg_system.c to be more
 easily reused by plug-ins other than mpeg_ps and mpeg_ts.

 That's all for tonight.

2002-03-04 Monday 22:20  gbazin

 * this time I actually commited the win32 modif to the input parser ;-)

2002-03-04 Monday 22:18  gbazin

 * We now make sure the aout plugin buffers always contain between
 AOUT_BUFFER_DURATION/2 and AOUT_BUFFER_DURATION*3/2 worth of audio.
 This should solve the audio buffer underruns.

 * fix for the bug in input when filename contains a '@' character.

 * simplified the win32 specific changes to the input parser. ( I think
 we can safely assume that no access plugin name will have a length of
 one character)

2002-03-04 Monday 01:53  stef

 [no log message]

2002-03-03 Sunday 20:42  gbazin

 * added network to the list of the plugins directories in Makefile
 * small bugfixes

2002-03-03 Sunday 17:34  xav

  * Fixed DVD input under Win32.
  * Fixed input parser under win32, chich couldn't understand that
 c:\windows\bureau is a valid file and doesn't need to be accessed with
 the plugin 'C' :-)
  * BTW, I added myself in the AUTHORS file :)

2002-03-03 Sunday 04:37  sam

   * Got rid of int_types.h and did a few changes Ipkiss will need. Hope I
     did not break other platforms.

2002-03-02 Saturday 09:34  gbazin

 * fixed compilation problem related to ssize_t

2002-03-02 Saturday 03:53  xav

  * Various Win32 compilation fixes.
  * DVD compiles, but doesn't work yet.
  * Fixed some typos in my previous Win32 multicast commit

2002-03-02 Saturday 03:51  sam

    * ./plugins/dummy/input_dummy.c: fixed `vlc vlc:quit'.
    * ./src/input/input.c: initialized uninitialized variables.

2002-03-02 Saturday 03:15  stef

 *Initiliaze p_access_module & p_demux_modules to NULL when input thread
 in created.

2002-03-01 Friday 16:07  sam

   * ./po/no.po: Norwegian translation by Sigmund Augdal. Berd ka p tt.
   * ./src/misc/modules.c: shortcuts for --intf work again, gvlc launches the
     Gtk interface, qvlc launches the Qt interface, etc.
   * ./plugins/fx/scope.c: we now have sound together with --aout scope.

2002-03-01 Friday 01:12  stef

 *dvd and dvdread support for input III.

 Dvdread is known to segfault at title change. I'm working on this.

2002-03-01 Friday 00:33  massiot

 Input III (Episode 1).
 - Major rewrite of the buffer core functions
 - Modularity of access plugins (file, udp, http)
 - Modularity of network stack (ipv4, soon ipv6)
 - Autodetection of the type of stream

 And a new killing feature : HTTP streams are now seekable.

 Please note that dvd, dvdread and vcd plug-ins are broken and thus disabled.

2002-02-27 Wednesday 22:57  sam

   * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/vpar_headers.c: we no longer crash when the next
     stream doesn't have the same image size as the previous one.
   * ./src/audio_output/aout_pcm.c: another overrun fix; please test.

2002-02-27 Wednesday 19:05  sam

   * ./configure.in: fixed a plugins/dsp.so compilation issue under OpenBSD.

2002-02-27 Wednesday 18:19  sam

   * ./plugins/dsp/aout_dsp.c: OpenBSD compilation fix.
   * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a segfault on exit.

2002-02-27 Wednesday 04:49  sam

   * ./src/input/input.c: BeOS network support (no idea if it works when you
     don't have BONE, though).

2002-02-27 Wednesday 03:47  sam

   * ./include/common.h: BeOS compile fixes.
   * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: fixed BeOS video output.

2002-02-26 Tuesday 22:08  gbazin

 * Fixed uninitialized variable in config_Duplicate()
 * Fixed problem introduced in latest gtk commit

2002-02-26 Tuesday 18:25  gbazin

 * forgot to add the declaration of server_port in main.c
 * char pointers obtained by config_GetPszVariable need to be freed

2002-02-26 Tuesday 17:22  xav

 Multicast now works under Win32, but this is a _bad_ kludge.

 It still segfaults 4 secondes after the first frame, but, at least, I
 can see two or three frames from MI2 :-)

2002-02-26 Tuesday 01:17  stef

 *Reversed my previous configuration change.

 I'd better used dvd_title or so but INPUT_TITLE_VAR is also used in
 gtk_open.c and I can't find a neat way to prevent this, so I leave this
 option in main.c.

2002-02-25 Monday 23:59  sam

   * ./include/threads.h: support for the State Threads Library, a userland
     threads library (http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/). Useless to most
     people, but can be handy to debug stuff. Activate with `--enable-st'.

2002-02-25 Monday 18:42  stef

 *Adaptation to new configuration scheme for dvd, dvdread and spdif

2002-02-25 Monday 04:30  sam

   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_menu.c: fixed a compile issue on IA64.
   * ./plugins/fx/scope.c: new toy plugin, an audio scope module.

     Each time I fix a bug in vlc I feel urge to code something useless. This
     one is very, very rough for the moment, probably buggy, slow, will crash
     your blender and reboot your fridge. Screenshot can be found here:
       http://www.zoy.org/~sam/vlc/vlc-scope.jpeg
     Activate with `--aout scope' (yes, it currently disables the real
     audio output... I'll fix this as well).

2002-02-24 Sunday 22:12  sam

   * Replacement header for aout_common.h.

2002-02-24 Sunday 22:06  sam

   * Fixed a quite old bug in the audio output which made the sound stutter
     when wrapping around the audio output fifo.
   * Lots of simplifications in the audio output, got rid of b_stereo.

2002-02-24 Sunday 21:36  jobi

 Added a menu in the GTK and gnome interfaces to change the current program
 in multi-program streams (such as ones provided by a DVB-S card).

2002-02-24 Sunday 20:51  gbazin

 This is the first part of the new configuration architecture for vlc.
 Two other parts will follow soon:
 - config file implementation
 - gtk configuration interface.

 This part won't change much for end-users as these changes are mostly
 internal, you will however notice that the command line interface has
 changed. It will maybe be less user-friendly as I almost removed the
 short options but it shouldn't a big problem when the config file is
 implemented.

 What as changed is that it is really easy now to add configuration
 options to vlc. Plugins can also implement configuration options. All
 you have to do is to declare a MODULE_CONFIG section in your plugin.
 If you want to know more about this look at configuration.h and for some
 example: main.c, dsp.c or xvideo.c

 It would be nice if every developper could now start using configuration
 options in there plugins and also enhance old plugins.

 That's it, now let's hope I didn't break too many things ;-)

2002-02-23 Saturday 21:31  gbazin

 * fixed array over-run bug in intf_MsgUnsub

2002-02-22 Friday 20:46  gbazin

 * Don't try to grok altivec with mingw32.
 * --with-directx-path should now indicate the path where the actual
 headers are (before the headers had to be in an include subdir). By the
 way you can download these header files from the videolan web site.

2002-02-21 Thursday 23:56  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: if symbol foo isn't found in the
     plugin, we always try to open _foo, whatever the architecture.

2002-02-21 Thursday 00:54  sam

   * ./configure.in: gtk*-config detection fix for FreeBSD.

2002-02-20 Wednesday 23:23  sam

   * ./configure.in: removed a bashism.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: support for systems without shm.h.
   * QNX compilation fixes here and there; the qnx plugin still doesn't work.

2002-02-20 Wednesday 19:01  sam

   * ./Makefile: the win32 port now uses a more recent version of gtk+.

2002-02-20 Wednesday 05:56  sam

   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c: the log window is now black with colourful text.
   * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c: ported the log window to the GNOME interface.
   * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c: messages are sent to the queue even if
     -vvvv* wasn't specified.

2002-02-20 Wednesday 05:50  jlj

   * MacOS X VCD support.

2002-02-19 Tuesday 03:54  sam

   * ./plugins/lirc/lirc.: various fixes, thanks to Sigmund Augdal.
   * ./plugins/text/logger.c: rewrote an ugly loop.
   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c: added a Gtk+ window containing all the log
     messages; updated in real time. To open it, go to "view"->"messages".

2002-02-19 Tuesday 00:50  sam

    * Got rid of TRACE and intf_DbgMsg which were seldom used anyway.
    * All intf_*Msg functions now write to stderr.
    * Implemented a message queue interface plugins can subscribe to.
    * Wrote the logger interface plugin. Usage:
       vlc -I logger:filename.log
    * Lots of fixes in the SPU renderer.

2002-02-18 Monday 19:02  stef

 Fixed a typo in aspect ratio calculation

2002-02-18 Monday 01:34  jlj

   * MacOS X vout improvements
   * MacOS X intf now returns, allowing vlc to terminate properly
   * Added a new make target: package-macosx

2002-02-15 Friday 20:02  gbazin

 * Win32 compilation fixes (mingw includes dirent)
 * configure now checks for ddraw.h and not directx.h
 * vout_directx doesn't include directx.h anymore (this file isn't part of
     the directx sdk)
 * moved all the stuff from aout_waveout.c directly into waveout.c (I don't
     know what I was thinking about when I created these two files ;-)
 * until we fix the audio buffer underrun problem, waveout will be the
     default audio output on win32 (instead of directx).

2002-02-15 Friday 13:32  sam

   * ALL: got rid of *_Probe functions because most of them were duplicates
     of the real _Init or _Create functions. That's 1000 lines of code gained.
   * ./src/misc/modules.c: we try not to keep the global lock in module_Need,
     which should speed up output spawning.
   * ./plugins/dummy/input_dummy.c: fixed vlc:quit command.
   * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_playlist.c: compilation fix.
   * ./plugins/macosx/*: preliminary fixes for the vout4 port.

    Notes on the *_Probe eradication:
   o I probably broke the DirectX video output, because of the "must init and
     run in the same thread" issue. I'll fix this ASAP.
   o Subtitles are broken (or at least, pretty ugly) in RGB mode.
   o The input plugins still have *_Probe functions. This will disappear when
     meuuh is finished with the access plugins.
   o The decoder plugins still have *_Probe functions. This is probably not
     going to change, it looks OK to me.

2002-02-14 Thursday 23:29  sam

   * Grmbl. Forgot to commit those Win32 fixes last time, and they were
     stuck on VTHR. Sorry xav, this probably explains why I couldn't
     find the commit log :-)

2002-02-13 Wednesday 22:10  sam

   * ./plugins/beos/*: BeOS fixes from Rudolf Cornelissen.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: --desync now really accepts a value in ms.
   * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: fixed a crash when not opening a VCD.
   * ./src/video_output/vout_subpictures.c: fixed subtitles under BeOS and
     other architectures which don't support overlay.

2002-02-08 Friday 15:57  sam

   * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: ported the BeOS RGB video output to
     vout4. The overlay video output still needs to be written though.

2002-02-06 Wednesday 20:44  gbazin

 * Just renamed the liba52_adec plugin into a52 to comply with the naming
 convention used by the other plugins.

2002-02-06 Wednesday 02:37  sam

   * ./plugins/lirc/lirc.c: IR remote control plugin by Sigmund Augdal
     <sigmunau@stud.ntnu.no>, activate with --enable-lirc.
   * ./configure.in: put liba52_adec in a builtin for PIC/non-PIC reasons.

2002-02-05 Tuesday 21:46  gbazin

 * New AC3 decoder plugin using liba52 from Aaron Holtzman and
     Michel Lespinasse.
     This plugin isn't used by default, you have to specify:
     --ac3_adec liba52

2002-02-04 Monday 09:58  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: changed module_Need to make it possible to
     have several modules with the same shortcut name.

2002-01-30 Wednesday 23:41  fgp

 *) We now call lockFocus on the QuickDrawView before attempting to get it's qdport.

2002-01-30 Wednesday 00:09  sam

   * Fixed stuff in the wall filter. Extended syntax:
      --filter wall         % open a wall (3x3 is the default value)
      --filter wall:2       % open a 2x2 wall
      --filter wall:3x2     % open a 3x2 wall
      --filter wall:2x1:0   % open a 2x1 wall, only display block 0
      --filter wall:2:0,3   % open a 2x2 wall, only display blocks 0 and 3
     For instance, if you have 2 computers listening to a network stream, on
     the left computer you use --filter wall:2x1:0 and on the right computer
     you use --filter wall:2x1:1

2002-01-29 Tuesday 20:11  gbazin

 * Added mstrtime() to module_symbols_t so we can compile the mpeg_vdec
     plugin with TRACE mode enabled.

2002-01-28 Monday 23:08  stef

 -Fixed ac3_spdif which has been broken recently,

 -Check frequency in ac3_adec and change fifo if needed,

 -Moved initialisation of p_aout from plugins to audio_output.c
 If audio output rate is psecified at launch time, we try to use it by default.

 Note that audio output currently suffers from frequent underruns.
 This has not been fixed here.

2002-01-28 Monday 16:51  sam

   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: MMX YUV to RGB transformation for 15bpp.

2002-01-26 Saturday 01:18  tcastley

 Fixed compliation error due to inclusion of threads.h

2002-01-25 Friday 17:18  sam

   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: we don't use DPMS functions if they are
     not available.

2002-01-25 Friday 06:43  gbazin

 * Added a new very simple audio plugin for Win32. This plugin uses the
     waveOut API which is a lot easier to use for streaming stuff than
     directsound. (you don't have to take care of underflows anymore
     because it doesn't use circular buffers).
     If you are having a lot of underflows, this plugin is currently
     better adapted than the directx plugin.

 * Moved some initialization stuff in audio_out.c so we can now the
     caracteristics of the audio stream before calling aout_Open().

2002-01-24 Thursday 21:54  fgp

 *) Changed configure.in to check for all header files the macosx plugin needs
 *) There is now an option --disable-macosx, instead of --enable-macosx.
    --disable-macosx is default for all plattforms except MACOSX
 *) The mouse cursor is hidden when playing in fullscreen mode
 *) The screensaver is deactivated when playing in fullscreen mode
    (Thanks to Julian Mayer <julianmayer>@mac.com)
 *) Stop, Prev and Next buttons work now.

2002-01-24 Thursday 18:50  stef

 Configure and Makefile tweaking for dvdread module.
 It is now activated with option --with-dvdread, that takes the same options
 as --with-dvdcss.
 If you link with libdvdread statically dvdread is compiled builtin ; if you
 link dynamically, it is compiled as a plugin.

2002-01-24 Thursday 13:32  sam

   * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: fixed a missing function initialization
     which made decoder plugins segfault in GetChunk calls.
   * ./configure.in: proper soundcard.h check from Yves Duret.

2002-01-23 Wednesday 03:15  stef

 *Merged hh patch in libdvdcss from main tree.

 *Updated local libdvdread, so that it does not depend on libdvdcss
 (ala dummy_dvdcss) and modified configure to reflect changes.

2002-01-21 Monday 23:57  massiot

 * Decoders do not necessarily use bit stream (see mad plug-in)
 * mad PTS should finally be accurate
 * Some configure changes.

2002-01-21 Monday 07:00  gbazin

 * Fixed crashes on exit in the directx plugin
 * vout_PlacePicture is now accepting picture width=height=0

 * Win32 (NT/2000/XP) fix for libdvdcss: first attempt to open the DVD
   device in read/write mode so we can use ioctls. If this fails
   (insufficent privileges) we at least open in read-only mode so the
   libdvdcss title decryption method can be used.

2002-01-21 Monday 05:14  sam

   * ./configure.in: added extra checks for strange compilers such as
     Borland C++ which do not support all gcc options. Note that vlc does
     not compile with bcc32 yet, but is getting closer and closer to.

2002-01-21 Monday 00:52  sam

   * ./plugins/win32: skeleton for the win32 interface Ipkiss is developing.
   * ./config.guess ./config.sub: latest GNU versions.
   * ./configure.in: when possible, xvideo is compiled as a plugin.
   * ./vlc.spec: fixed a few minor inaccuracies.
   * ./debian/control: vlc-gui is no longer depended on, but rather recommended.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: --spumargin flag; use this to force displaying
     subtitles at the bottom of the screen instead of putting them in the
     middle, for instance: `--spumargin 5'.

2002-01-17 Thursday 23:02  gbazin

 * major rewrite of the directx video plugin to adapt it to the new vout4
     architecture. This plugin has also been through a major clean-up
     and it is now much more robust and optimized.

 * Fixed a few problems with the win32 build.

 * Replaced the "overlay" command line option with "nooverlay". The
     former was confusing and useless because overlays were used by
     default anyway.

2002-01-17 Thursday 16:17  sam

   * ./vlc.spec: imported MandrakeSoft's new spec file.
   * ./debian/control: fixed build-dependencies for vlc-mad.

2002-01-16 Wednesday 04:47  sam

   * ./debian/rules: fixed the vlc-arts and vlc-mad package builds.

2002-01-15 Tuesday 19:01  stef

 The gnome/gtk interface should no longer user p_input->stream before it
 has been initialized.

2002-01-15 Tuesday 17:55  stef

 *stream lock is initialized in input_CreateThread instead of initThread,
 to have it initialized when we call it in the interface.

2002-01-15 Tuesday 11:51  asmax

 - added support for S8 and U16 aout (not tested)
 - The sound is very dirty in U8 mode. I don't know if it comes from the
 8 bit mode itself or from the S16->U8 conversion.

2002-01-15 Tuesday 01:01  sam

   * ./debian/control: fixed Debian build-depends.
   * ./include/config.h: changed RELEASE to HAVE_RELEASE because RELEASE
     is already defined in <scsi/scsi.h> under Linux.

2002-01-14 Monday 23:46  massiot

 * More precise way to retrieve a PTS from the bit stream.
 * Fixed issues in the PTS handling of the mad plug-in (incomplete).

2002-01-14 Monday 21:00  jpsaman

 Configure, build and install instructions for libmad library and mad plugin.

2002-01-14 Monday 19:54  asmax

 - le coup de grce: all the code in audio output is now factorized (except
 for ac3 spdif) in aout_common.c/.h
 - aout thread functions are declared with a macro

 TODO:
 - test unsigned 8 bit output, and implement S8 and U16 outputs
 - multi-channel support
 - check if resampling takes the PTS into account (and fix it)

2002-01-14 Monday 12:15  asmax

 HUGE cleanings in audio output:
 - removed AOUT_INTF_*_FIFO, which where not used
 - factorized S16StereoPlay, U8MonoPlay, and so on.., in a single
   function aout_FillBuffer (in aout_common.c)
   (unsigned 8bit may be broken, but I have no stream to test with :(

 - last step to be done: factorize aout_s8, aout_s16, ... thanks to a macro

2002-01-13 Sunday 18:13  gbazin

 * A few fixes for the Win32 build.

2002-01-13 Sunday 15:07  gbazin

 * Fixed all the problems related to ToggleFullScreen().

2002-01-12 Saturday 21:58  jlj

   * ./src/misc/modules.c: Fixed a compile issue under platforms without
     HAVE_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS.

2002-01-12 Saturday 02:02  jlj

   * ./src/interface/intf_eject.c: MacOS X port.

2002-01-12 Saturday 01:25  sam

   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: 24/32 bpp software YUV.
   * ./plugins/ggi/ggi.c: activated double buffering.
   * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: we create more Xv pictures to
     get smoother rendering.

2002-01-11 Friday 03:07  sam

   * BSD compilation fix suggested by Steven M. Schultz.

 - beginning of code factorization in aout_s16 (more cleaning will come)
 - As for libmad, I have tried to create the aout fifo in libmad_output,
   to open it with the right sample rate, but strangely it didn't work.

2002-01-10 Thursday 04:11  sam

   * ./src/input/input.c: fixed a few segfaults caused by the dummy plugin.
   * ./plugins/mpeg_adec/mpeg_adec.c: fixed a segfault due to misuse of
     DecoderError.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: replaced XFlush with XSync. This must be the
     fourth time someone has to commit this, so I added a reminder :-)

2002-01-09 Wednesday 10:22  sam

   * ./src/interface/intf_eject.c: BSD/OS port by Steven M. Schultz.

2002-01-09 Wednesday 02:01  sam

   * ./include/modules_inner.h: replaced _X with __VLC_SYMBOL because _X was
     already a system macro under MacOS X.
   * ./plugins/dummy/dummy.c: fixed vlc:loop, vlc:quit, etc. entries.
   * ./plugins/glide/glide.c: activated double buffering.
   * ./plugins/mga/xmga.c: started writing an xmga plugin; doesn't work yet.
   * ./src/input/input.c: fixed the input memory leak, and the insane thread
     spawning we got with vlc:loop.
   * ./src/misc/intf_eject.c: disc ejection routine courtesy of Julien Blache,
     currently Linux-only.

2002-01-09 Wednesday 00:33  asmax

 - better communication between audio decoder and output: aout plugins
 are now opened directly in the right mode (works with mpeg_adec and
 ac3_adec, not tested with mad)
 - first attempt to implement mono output (doesn't work yet)

2002-01-07 Monday 17:02  sam

   ./debian/control: updated list of supported architectures.
   ./share/*: added 16x16 and 32x32 versions of PNG icons.

2002-01-07 Monday 02:12  sam

   * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: removed the mgammx module and put the code in
     the chroma_i420_ymga module instead. This introduces a slight
     performance issue as we now need to memcpy() the Y plane, but I have
     some vout4 enhancements on their way which make this point moot.
   * ./debian/changelog: imported official Debian changelog.
   * ./debian/control: activated the vlc-mad and vlc-arts packages; package
     builds should now work again.
   * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: solved a symbol resolution issue when vlc was
     compiled without libdvdcss which overflowed the return stack.
   * ./plugins/ggi/ggi.c: ported the GGI plugin to vout4.
   * ./plugins/glide/glide.c: ported the Glide plugin to vout4 (untested).
   * ./src/input/input.c: prepared everything for multi-input mode; since
     no interface is yet prepared to handle this, I changed them so that
     they just use the first available input for now. This may break other
     things, but I promise I'll eventually repair everything :-)

2002-01-06 Sunday 17:18  sam

   * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: MMX-accelerated version of the MGA plugin.
   * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/Makefile: Little workaround for PA-Risc compilation.

2002-01-05 Saturday 18:25  sam

   * ./src/audio_output/aout_s16.c: fixed a segfault. It may have unexpected
     side effects because I don't know this part of the code, but at least
     it doesn't crash anymore.
   * ./plugins/beos/beos.cpp: first attempt at porting the BeOS plugin to the
     new video output and module systems. Doesn't work nor even compile yet.
   * ./configure.in: we now check the gtk-config version.

2002-01-05 Saturday 16:09  sam

   * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: we use the MGA_VID_FSEL ioctl to select the
     frame to be displayed. Unfortunately, increasing the number of
     frames doesn't seem to work and makes the picture stutter...

2002-01-05 Saturday 15:17  sam

   * ./Makefile: fixed a bug when no builtins were selected.
   * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: ported the MGA video output to vout4. Only does YV12
     for the moment, and there is a strange bug with some streams which gives
     only a green image. Needs to be looked at.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed a few typos.

2002-01-05 Saturday 03:49  sam

   * ./configure.in: fix for obscure architectures like hppa where target_os
     isn't properly detected.
   * ./include/video_output.h: got rid of pf_setpalette; I'll find a nicer way.
   * ./plugins/mga.c: fixed MGA module compilation. Doesn't work yet, though.

2002-01-05 Saturday 02:22  sam

   * ./include/common.h: hton64 is now an inline function.
   * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c et al.: vout4 now automatically
     detects when two chroma formats are the same, such as UYVY/Y422, or
     roughly equivalent, such as I420/YV12. Plugins need not worry about
     conversion anymore.

2002-01-04 Friday 14:01  sam

   * ./BUGS: added a list of known bugs. Please add your findings!
   * ./MODULES: added a short description of each module. Maybe we should
     add more details to make this file really useful.
   * ./doc/bugreport-howto.txt: wishful thinking...
   * ./Makefile: added a workaround for the fact that .c files don't depend
     on <videolan/vlc.h>.
   * ./plugins/memcpy/memcpy.c: all memcpy modules are now built from the same
     single file.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: added the --nommx, --no3dnow, --nommxext, --nosse
     and --noaltivec options to vlc.
   * ./configure.in: removed the --disable-mmx option, now useless because
     of the vlc --no* options.
   * ./src/interface/main.c: fixed a crash caused by the memcpy module
     being released too early.
   * ./include/video.h: more vout4 changes, including margin support, more
     FOURCC formats recognized, transparent support of identical or almost
     identical FOURCC formats.
   * ./include/video_output.h: added a vout_Render function to video output
     modules which is to be executed before vout_Display.
   * ./include/common.h: this header is back.
   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb.c: planar YUV 4:2:0 to packed RGB conversion
     functions, mostly taken from vout3's yuv functions, but heavily modified
     to use FAST_MEMCPY and to handle image dimensions which are not multiples
     of 16. Not all functions have been written yet, though.
   * ./plugins/chroma/i420_yuy2.c: planar YUV 4:2:0 to packed YUV conversion
     functions, various targets such as 4:2:2 YUYV, YVYU, UYVY, or 2:1:1 YUYV,
     with accelerated MMX versions.
   * ./plugins/chroma/i422_yuy2.c: same as i420_yuy2.c but takes planar YUV
     4:2:2 pictures in input. With accelerated MMX versions as well. This plugin
     makes it possible to display 4:2:2 files on most video cards without the
     quality loss of 4:2:0 downsampling.
   * ./plugins/filter/*: thanks to the vout_Render function, all filters now
     output their data perfectly in sync.
   * ./plugins/dvdread/Makefile: fix to prevent unnecessary target rebuilds.
   * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: support for YV12, UYVY, YUY2 and YVYU overlays.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: support for I420, YV12, YUY2 and Y211 overlays.

2002-01-02 Wednesday 14:37  sam

   * ./ChangeLog: imported the 0.2.92 changes, unrolled current CVS changes.
   * ./include/config.h et al.: this file is no longer generated.
   * ./include/video.h: we use the FOURCC definition of a chroma format to
     describe picture types (see http://www.webartz.com/fourcc/).
   * ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: compilation fix by Eyal Lebedinsky.
   * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed the XShm operations order.

   * Fixed detection of the esd plugin.
   * Fixed the ts plugin's input type detection.
   * Fixed the BadCursor error in the x11 and xvideo plugins. For real this
     time (unlike my 2001/08/03 fix :p).
   * Made the wall filter work a bit better. It now spawns a 3x2 mosaic,
     but this will eventually be configurable,  la `--filter wall:3x3'.

 Miscellaneous typos.

2001-12-30 Sunday 07:09  sam

 Some heavy changes today:
   * Removed duplicate function checks from configure.in.
   * Added extra magic to Makefile.modules so that the module Makefiles
     are now ridiculously simple. And I mean *simple*. Check it! This will
     make a possible switch to full autoconf/automake a lot easier.
   * Added the vlc version name to the plugin symbols, to be sure we only load
     plugins with the same version number. A nasty consequence is that you
     need to rebuild your tree after midnight if you are using a CVS tree :-)
   * Got rid of modules_export.h by #defining exported functions in the same
     header as their prototype.
   * Added modules_inner.h and other commonly used .h files to common.h so
     there are less and less files to include, and renamed common.h to
     <videolan/vlc.h>.
   * First modifications to the module handling system towards my ultimate
     goal to get rid of the *_Probe functions. Got rid of TestMethod and
     TestCPU, as well as src/misc/tests.c.
   * Wrote the chroma plugin handling functions. No YUV functions have been
     ported yet because it'ls a lot of work, but the core system works, I
     tried it with a naive yv12->rgb16 plugin (which will disappear when the
     real functions are ready).
   * Made a lot of functions in dvd_summary.c one-liners to avoid wasting
     too many output lines.
   * Fixed a segfault in input_dvd.c:DVDInit.
   * Added a fixfiles.sh script in plugins/gtk to be run after Glade has
     generated its C files.
   * Did some work on the KDE interface to make it suck a bit less. It still
     segfaults, but at least it runs and it looks less ugly.
   * RGB SDL rendering works again, though in 16bpp only.
   * Made plugins/vcd/linux_cdrom_tools.c independent of any vlc structure
     so that it'll be easily put in a library. Maybe libdvdcss?
   * Fixed VCD date display.
   * Merged vout_xvideo.c, vout_x11.c and vout_common.c into xcommon.c.
   * Wrote non-Shm XVideo output.
   * Made X11 output work again. Still pretty unstable, only works for 16bpp.
   * Additional french translation in po/fr.po. Any taker for the rest?
   * Fixed a segfault in video_output.c when the allocated pictures were
     not direct buffers.
   * If $DISPLAY isn't set, don't try to run the Gtk+ interface.
   * Replaced 48x48 .xpm images with 32x32 ones to conform to Debian policy
     (Closes Debian bug #126939).
   * Removed the automatic ./configure launch when running `make all' for
     the first time.

 Stuff currently more broken than it ought to be:
   * The wall filter. Being fixed.
   * x11 and sdl plugins for depth != 16bpp.
   * Software YUV.
   * gvlc, gnome-vlc, kvlc shortcuts. Use --intf instead for the moment.

   * Forgot a file in my last commit.

2001-12-30 Sunday 05:38  sam

   * Put ErrorThread() in input_ext-dec.h because it was the same function
     in all decoders. Called it DecoderError() instead.
   * All decoders enter DecoderError() in case of error, even if they
     haven't allocated all their data. This prevents the input from getting
     stuck if a decoder has failed its initialization.
   * Namespace fixes through the decoder files.

2001-12-29 Saturday 03:44  massiot

 Next Generation Buffer Manager for DVD and VCD plug-ins.

2001-12-19 Wednesday 03:50  sam

   * Initialize SDL before opening the SDL audio output.
   * Prevent two SDL video outputs or audio outputs to be spawned at the
     same time to avoid ugly crashes.
   * The SDL plugin now says whether we are using software or hardware YUV
     in its window title.
   * We now stop at the first ':' when looking for a module name, to easily
     pass information to the modules. Possible example: --vout sdl:software,
     implementation of such an option is left as an exercise.
   * Merged filter_bob and filter_bob422 into filter_bob. Use --filter bob
     to deinterlace 422 into 420 as well.
   * Factorized code common to most filters and the video output, optimized
     a few filters by aligning data and reading 64 bits at a time.
   * Two new absolutely useless, CPU-eating, resource-wasting, but fun
     filters: enjoy `transform', which performs flips and 90 rotations, and
     `distort', which performs animated image effects (currently only a naive
     sine wave is implemented). Usage examples:
        --filter transform:hflip
        --filter transform:vflip
        --filter transform:90
        --filter transform:180
        --filter transform:270
        --filter distort:wave

     for my nevrotic and destructive pulsions during the next few hours!

   * If you want to test vlc, please use the v0_2_92_branch branch.

   * Stuff currently working:
      - direct to YUV buffer decoding
      - non-ugly subtitle blending
      - XVideo and SDL video output

   * Stuff currently utterly broken:
      - aspect ratio
      - software rendering (ie, all other video output plugins)

   * Additional misc changes:
      - Renamed spu_dec to spudec and mad_adec to mad to stay coherent with
        other plugins. Also, renamed mpeg to mpeg_system.
      - Added jobi to the AUTHORS file.

 other plug-ins.

2001-11-29 Thursday 01:01  fgp

   *) Added "#include <string.>" to include/threads.h
      It' wouldn't compile on OSX without this.

   *) Removed the mutex the vout and intf thread (were supposed to use)
      for syncronizing acces to the p_vout->p_sys structure.
      The p_vout->change_lock mutex is used for syncronization now. (and
      should make synronization work)

2001-11-28 Wednesday 15:08  massiot

 from 12 to 13 (due to change from ts:// to udpstream://)

2001-11-25 Sunday 22:52  gbazin

  * Big clean-up to allow compiling every module as plugins.
  * Added bytes_swap.h to provide ntoh() and htol() on Win32. With this
      change we don't have to link winsock2 with every plugin anymore. This
      should also give us a slight speed increase.
  * Added #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN in threads.h to speed-up compilation
      on Win32.
  * Modified ac_downmix_3dn and sse so they compile with the latest gcc for
      Win32.

 (PS: the dvdread plugin doesn't compile yet on Win32)

2001-11-25 Sunday 05:04  stef

 Support for libdvdread.

 Libdvdread files are in extras/libdvdread. They have not been changed from
 those of libdvdread 0.9.2. The changes are in the subdirectory videolan.
 They basically consist of a new function in the API that does a readv()
 instead fo a read().

 The library is statically linked with libdvdcss from extras/libdvdcss, and
 the whole is statically linked with the plugin dvdread. Dvdread can only be
 compiled as a builtin module for the time being, I think (which means I
 haven't tried to compile it as a plugin).

 Basically, input_dvdread.c is a copy and paste from input_dvd.c with a few
 changes to use libdvdread calls. It is still in very alpha stage, but it
 should offer the same features as the current DVD input.

 It can be called with either the syntax: "dvdread:/dev/dvd"
 or "--input dvdread /dev/dvd". The command line switches (-t, -T, -c, -u)
 should work too.

2001-11-25 Sunday 01:26  sam

   * Added "Video" menu hint to debian/*menu (Closes Debian bug #121036).

2001-11-23 Friday 18:47  massiot

 Major rewrite of the network layer. The following syntax ARE NO LONGER
 SUPPORTED :
 ts:toto:1234/meuh
 --server toto --broadcast meuh --port 1234

 The only supported syntax is :
 udp[stream]:[//][serveraddr:[serverport]][@[bindaddr][:bindport]]
 example : udpstream:toto@meuh:toto

 In most cases, simply passing "udpstream:" should work, since it enables
 unicast and broadcast reception on port 1234 from any server. Other
 options are only used for fine tuning and multicast.

 TODO :
 * The GTK interface is broken (glade knowledge wanted !)
 * Test this on all supported platforms (and fix them :)
 [this won't work with current channel servers - fix needed]

2001-11-21 Wednesday 22:33  jlj

 The default file-translation mode was not being set under win32.
 In other words, file playback in 0.2.91 does not work. For de-

 causing problems under WinXP. I hope this does not introduce
 problems under previous windows versions. I noticed it was
 originally 0ms, but later changed to 1ms...

 Added VCD input plugin for Linux :

 The Linux specific stuff is located in linux_cdrom_tools files.
 For the time being, it only has title (tracks). Chapters will come if I
 ever can read .vcd files.
 I've modified Gnome and GTK+, not the others.
 I've noticed a big bug, it segfaults at the end of a title. I will
 have a look on this tomorrow.
 Please be indulgent, it's my first peace of code ;-)

 Use of an environment variable to choose libdvdcss method.

2001-10-13 Saturday 15:34  stef

 New features for libdvdcss: we have three ways now to decode a title key.

 1) Crack the title key (the method that was here before). The only change
 here is that we search the key for the exact chapter we are seeking with
 DVDSetArea (in case the key has changed within a title). It is maybe not a
 good idea.

 2) Crack the disc key, which allows us to decode instantly all title keys.
 I've used an algorithm from Frank Stevenson ; it eats much memory (64MB),
 and takes about 15 s at launch time.

 3) Decode the disc key with player keys (libcss method). However, you need
 licensed player keys at build time for that to work.

 To choose between libdvdcss methods, a command line options is supplied:

         vlc --dvdcss <method> where method is one of title, disc, key.

 Note that all these changes only work with linux now, since we have to add a
 specific ioctl to read title key. I hope that I haven't broken too many things.

 Miscellaneous updates to configure, especially for cross-compilation.

2001-09-09 Sunday 13:43  sam

  Changes to vlc:

   * Fixed arch-dependant build dependencies (Closes Debian bug #109722).
   * Minor changes to the (non-working) ncurses interface.

  Changes to libdvdcss (courtesy of Hkan Hjort <d95hjort@dtek.chalmers.se>):

   * If we see 3000 unencrypted blocks assume that the title is unencrypted.
   * If we have not seen any encrypted block and then discover that the block
     just read is not a valid block of an MPEG2 Program stream, assume that the
     title is unencrypted.
   * Empty keys (for unscrambled sectors) are now cached as well.
   * We try to decrypt the file even if DVD ioctls are not available.

2001-09-06 Thursday 18:21  henri

 - Fixed a netlist packet leak in demuxPSI (Mark Gritter <mgritter@kealia.com>).

 - Removed the nuts message "unable to allocate memory" when the netlist got
 empty.

 - Cosmetic changes.

2001-09-06 Thursday 13:24  massiot

 Another fix for the altivec detection.

2001-09-06 Thursday 10:39  massiot

 Fixed numerous bugs with the Altivec IDCT (still not compiling).

2001-09-06 Thursday 07:31  henri

 Added gnome.h check and cleaned the error messages in the configure
 script

2001-09-06 Thursday 04:28  henri

 A very tiny small useless optimization in the LPCM decoder

2001-09-05 Wednesday 16:07  massiot

 * Altivec IDCT and motion compensation, based on Paul Mackerras's mpeg2dec
 (untested !) ;
 * Local minor optimizations in IDCT ;
 * Removed a hopeless kludge in input_clock.c

2001-08-27 Monday 16:13  massiot

 IP Multicast support, courtesy of Mathias Kretschmer <mathias@research.att.com>.

2001-08-24 Friday 10:51  sam

   * Fixed build dependencies for architectures not supporting libasound2
     (Closes Debian bug #109722).

2001-08-23 Thursday 15:39  sam

   * Attempt to fix the SDL detection under *BSD.

2001-08-23 Thursday 13:24  massiot

 Removed /usr/local/include, because it is unsafe in a cross-compilation
 environment. If you have problems with this, tell me and we'll find an
 alternate solution.

2001-08-22 Wednesday 21:18  gbazin

 - The win32 port is once again using msvcrt.dll instead of msvcrt40.dll
 - Fixed a synchro bug (typo) in video_output.c

2001-08-22 Wednesday 18:47  massiot

 * Added a documentation to use VLC as a netscape plug-in and do some
 (buggy) web streaming.

2001-08-22 Wednesday 17:21  massiot

 * Totally rewrote the video decoder (inspired by walken's mpeg2dec), implying :
 - performance boost ;
 - fixed the "Dual Prime Arithmetic" bug ;
 - 3DNow! motion compensation module ;
 * BTW, fixed numerous bugs ;
 * AC3dec statistics do not show up with --enable-stats, because I doubt
 they're understandable by a normal human being, and they pollute the output.

2001-08-22 Wednesday 15:16  sam

   * Grmbl. Forgot to update the libdvdcss changelog.

2001-08-22 Wednesday 14:23  sam

   * Split ChangeLog into ChangeLog and ChangeLog.libdvdcss.
   * Added --xvadaptor flag to select the XVideo adaptor to use.
   * Everything is ready for the 0.2.83 release.

2001-08-19 Sunday 23:35  sam

   * Added support in ./configure for the cprof profiler.
   * Activated -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D__USE_UNIX98 on all platforms, fixes
     issues under Solaris and QNX.
   * Additional checks for SSE-specific (non-MMXEXT) instructions, as
     reported in <20010817114220.A23480@slartibartfast.angrypacket.com>.

2001-08-14 Tuesday 17:53  sam

   * Fixed yesterday's pthread detection fix.

2001-08-14 Tuesday 04:52  sam

   * GNU/Hurd configuration and compilation fixes.

2001-08-14 Tuesday 00:00  sam

   * Fixed a crash in subtitle rendering.
   * Activated old crappy subtitle rendering in overlay mode (ugly but
     probably better than having no subtitles at all).

2001-08-13 Monday 12:24  sam

   * Added missing debian files I forgot to add a long time ago.
   * Fixed libglide2/libglide3 inconsistency in debian/control.

2001-08-10 Friday 17:43  sam

   * Another mistake in the BSD/OS configuration process.

2001-08-10 Friday 17:14  massiot

 Added --with-sdl-config-path option if you sdl-config is not in $PATH.

2001-08-10 Friday 16:38  sam

   * Added proper Conflicts: rules in debian/control.
   * configure.in fixes for BSD/OS.

2001-08-09 Thursday 23:12  sam

   * Added BSD/OS libdvd by Steven M. Schultz <sms@TO.GD-ES.COM> in
     extras/BSDI_dvdioctl after he suggested it. License is GPL.
   * ./configure now checks for an installed libdvd under BSD/OS and
     falls back to ours if not found.
   * Fixed harmless typos in yesterday's Solaris libdvd patches.
   * Bumped libdvdcss version number up to 0.0.3 ; release will probably
     follow once the BSDI changes have been tested.

2001-08-09 Thursday 20:16  jlj

 Fixed a memory leak in the ifo parser and input_EndStream

2001-08-09 Thursday 08:20  sam

   * Fixed a bug in the gtk interface which caused vlc to go amok after
     having met a zero-sized area.
   * Found out how to type '' in vim :-)
   * Added missing bloat to modules_export.h.
   * 'snapshot*' rules do not depend on 'clean', and don't use /tmp anymore.
   * Added vlc:loop playlist command to go back at the beginning.
     Usage: vlc file1.mpeg file2.mpeg ... fileN.mpeg vlc:loop
     This change isn't very elegant but there are already bugs in the
     playlist handling, I'll try to polish it once the playlist is fixed.

2001-08-08 Wednesday 02:48  sam

   * Solaris DVD decryption support by H}kan Hjort <d95hjort@dtek.chalmers.se>.

2001-08-07 Tuesday 10:54  sam

   * Updated version number to 0.2.82.
   * Updated ChangeLog.
   * Fixed a typo in Makefile.dep.

2001-08-07 Tuesday 02:48  sam

   * Got Makefile to launch ./configure almost properly. $(MAKECMDGOALS) rules !
   * Various debian scripts fixes.
   * Added -lmsvcrt40 to the win32 flags for proper execution under Wine.
   * Fixed broken soname setting under Solaris (and OS X, sort of).
   * Made the illegal instruction report more explicit.
   * BSD/OS 4.3beta1 fixes by Steven M. Schultz <sms@TO.GD-ES.COM>.

2001-08-06 Monday 13:46  sam

   * libdvdcss* packages are now a bit more policy-compliant.

2001-08-06 Monday 13:27  sam

   * Added a dummy libdvdcss so that the DVD plugin can be used without
     libdvdcss. It will try to dlopen() libdvdcss at runtime, though,
     and will use the dummy functions only if it couldn't find a valid
     libdvdcss. This is probably only useful to package maintainers.

   * Tidied the snapshot-* Makefile rules.
   * Tidied the modules Makefiles.
   * Removed useless stuff in the debian/ directory.
   * Removed the "make all" kludge in the Makefile.opts rule. I hope this
     patch is harmless on all systems.

2001-08-05 Sunday 15:32  gbazin

 * Big rewrite of the DirectX audio plugin. The audio output is now (almost)
     perfect on Win32.
 * Fixed a bug in ac3dec_CreateThread() in ac3_decoder_thread.
 * On Win32, open() will now open files in binary mode by default.
 * A few minor changes to vout_xvideo.c

2001-08-03 Friday 18:03  gbazin

 Oops, forgot to commit this file.

2001-07-31 Tuesday 21:13  gbazin

 * Fixed a segfault in PSEnd in input_ps.c
 * The video decoder thread is now also reniced to a lower priority on
   Win32 (as in the linux version). This slightly increases the responsiveness of vlc.

2001-07-30 Monday 14:13  massiot

 * Now use SDL_CFLAGS for searching SDL/SDL.h.

2001-07-30 Monday 13:57  massiot

 * Don't miserably die in `make` when ./configure hasn't be run ;
 * Fixed a bug when compiling KDE plug-in without Qt plug-in ;
 * Now taking into account $KDEDIR ;
 * Made SDL configure error messages more explicit ;
 * --disable-sdl is now correctly taken into account ;
 * Changed the order of evaluation of sdl-config and sdl11-config ;
 * Finally fixed SDL*/SDL.h check ;

2001-07-30 Monday 00:53  sam

   * VC++/Intel compiler fixes by Jon Lech Johansen <jon-vl@nanocrew.net>.

2001-07-29 Sunday 22:54  sam

   * Better gtk-config detection.
   * Removed duplicate checks in configure.in.
   * Fixed a typo in vlc.spec.

2001-07-28 Saturday 02:17  sam

   * Fix in libdvdcss in the key caching code.
   * Removed useless variables in configure.in which caused all subsequent
     compilation tests to fail.

2001-07-27 Friday 16:23  sam

   * Additional fixes to the sdl-config detection.

2001-07-27 Friday 16:14  sam

   * Added a make uninstall rule.

2001-07-27 Friday 14:43  sam

   * Updated version numbers for imminent release.
   * Fixed the --with-dvdcss flag:
      o --with-dvdcss - build libdvdcss, link statically (also default behaviour)
      o --with-dvdcss=local-static - build libdvdcss, link statically
      o --with-dvdcss=local-shared - build libdvdcss, link dynamically
      o --with-dvdcss=/foo/bar - don't build libdvdcss, use libdvdcss in /foo/bar
   * Fixed an omission in the dvdcss.h header.

2001-07-27 Friday 01:05  sam

   * Changed libdvdcss API to force binary incompatibility. Yeah, this is
     evil, but if we don't do it now we'll have to do it when more people
     are using it.
   * Fixed minor libdvdcss stuff such as the soname and compilation flags.
   * New --with-dvdcss flag.
     Explanation:
      o default: build libdvdcss, statically link vlc against it.
      o --with-dvdcss=no: build libdvdcss, dynamically link vlc against it.
      o --with-dvdcss=yes: don't build libdvdcss, use already installed one.
      o --with-dvdcss=/foo: don't build libdvdcss, use libdvdcss from /foo/*.
     (this looks a bit strange to me, I'll find better flag settings)

2001-07-26 Thursday 20:00  reno

 * Format asm functions for gcc
   -> fixed the segfaults with imdct_sse
   -> sound is hugly with imdct_sse in debug mode

2001-07-26 Thursday 14:53  massiot

 Now using gcc -pipe.

2001-07-26 Thursday 09:08  massiot

 Accept SDL 1.1.5 or later.

2001-07-26 Thursday 03:13  sam

   * Fixed the MMX YUV plugin issues with gcc 2.96 and 3.0.
   * Updated TODO, cosmetic changes.

2001-07-25 Wednesday 19:14  massiot

 Now use sdl-config for SDL.

2001-07-25 Wednesday 14:51  bozo

 The spdif audio output won't kill itself anymore at the beginning.

2001-07-25 Wednesday 08:41  gbazin

  * dvdcss_readv optimisations for Win32. We now send only one read command
    to the DVD drive for the whole iovec.
  * Fixed _win32_dvdcss_aread to work around the WinASPI32 64kb transfer
    size restriction.
  * New and theoretically better Win32 pthread implementation which fixes a
    problem I was having when changing title on a DVD (netlist related).
    vlc_cond_multicast may or may not work.
  * Fixed the "quit" event handling in directx/vout_events.c.
  * dvd_ifo.c now takes into account error messages from UDFFindFile.
  * Temporarily disabled aout_Probe() in aout_SDL (this function
    is creating an awful lot of problems - libSDL bug ).

2001-07-25 Wednesday 03:53  sam

   * Updated ChangeLog.

2001-07-25 Wednesday 03:12  sam

   * ncurses compilation fix by Michael Mondragon <mammon@lokmail.net>.
   * fix for large inline functions and gcc 3.0.
   * fixed the gnome plugin so that it does not include gtk headers.

2001-07-24 Tuesday 11:16  xav

 Removed the changes made ; vlc should compile when following the
 instructions in INSTALL-win32.

2001-07-24 Tuesday 09:40  xav

 Quick and ugly hack in the makefile to allow vlc_win32 to compile when
 getting it directly from the CVS. As a result, the vlc_win32 program
 doesn't have an icon any more. Too bad.

2001-07-20 Friday 16:20  massiot

 Fixed the "paused movie won't restart" bug.

2001-07-19 Thursday 11:50  massiot

 * QNX RTOS plug-in by Jon Lech Johansen.

2001-07-19 Thursday 11:42  massiot

 * FreeBSD compilation fix, by yvind Kolbu.

2001-07-18 Wednesday 17:05  massiot

 * Updated documentation with recent changes ;
 * Decoders are niced again, for it is really better.

2001-07-18 Wednesday 15:21  massiot

 A BIG kludge for the calculation of mux_rate, so that times displayed in
 the scroll bar are now correct for MPEG-2 streams. There is probably a
 better way to do it, but I haven't found in months.

2001-07-18 Wednesday 14:21  massiot

 * Rewrote the video decoder to take advantage of several processors (SMP mode) ;
 * Fixed a bug in the video decoder initialization :-p ;
 * Added --smp option and several hooks in src/input/input_ext-intf.c ;
 * Grayscale mode now turns off chroma IDCT.

2001-07-17 Tuesday 09:48  massiot

 Cleaned up include/. Unnecessary headers are no longer under include/, but
 under src/. (eat that)

2001-07-16 Monday 22:00  gbazin

 Added intf_DbgMsg and intf_DbgMsgImm symbols to modules_export.h
 This fixes the TRACE build.

2001-07-16 Monday 16:40  massiot

 ...and the associated Makefile modifications.

2001-07-16 Monday 16:26  massiot

 * Exploded the outdated generic decoder ;
 * Updated ChangeLog and TODO.

2001-07-16 Monday 15:54  massiot

 * Added IDEALX developer documentation into main CVS - PLEASE UPDATE
 REGULARLY ;
 * Cleaned up doc/ directory.

2001-07-16 Monday 12:10  massiot

 Fixed GetChunk for chunks < 4 bytes.

2001-07-12 Thursday 23:06  gbazin

 - Fixed 2 Win32 bugs in libdvdcss (in _win32_dvdcss_readv), one of them
     should have prevented the Win9x dvd input from working.
 - Moved the "if(Win2k)" out of the loop in _win32_dvdcss_readv.

 - Put a readv() function in input_iovec.h, the input_es now compiles.
 - Modified input_ts to use this function.

 - Fixed an initialisation bug in vout_directx.c
 - Right clicking on the mouse now displays the navigation menu.

 PS: If someone is willing to test the DVD input on Win95/98/Me I will
     upload an up to date binary package.

2001-07-12 Thursday 20:31  reno

 * Fix audio/video synchro bug with esd
 * Should fix buggy sound due to 44100-48000 Hz conversions

2001-07-11 Wednesday 02:01  sam

   * libdvdcss enhancements by Billy Biggs <vektor@dumbterm.net>. This breaks
     vlc's DVD input (looks like decoders are expecting data too early and
     DVD input can't cope with it due to decryption). Needs to be investigated.
   * Plugins are now compiled in plugins/* and libraries in lib/*.
   * The KDE UI compiles again but does not work yet.
   * ALSA plugin message corrections.
   * Calculation modules can now be calledwith a shorter name
     (eg. '--downmix mmx' instead of '--downmix downmixmmx').
   * Fixed insane verbosity of the SDL plugin.

2001-07-10 Tuesday 06:07  gbazin

 - Fixed the segfault in vout_UnloadFont
 - DestroyThread in video_output doesn't call pf_destroy if pf_create has
     failed previously.
 - The Xvideo plugin now closes the video window when it XVideoGetPort
     fails in vout_Create.

2001-07-08 Sunday 23:15  reno

 * Alignement in asm functions
 * 16 bytes alignement for data (need fo SSE)
 * Optimization in SSE

2001-07-08 Sunday 17:45  gbazin

 Win32 changes only:

  - defined off_t as a long long. This allows DVD navigation to work.
    This change is to be implemented on a compiler by compiler basis. For
    now, it works on mingw32 (tested) and should work on MSVC (not tested).

  - Implemented a quick and dirty hack in intf_msg.c to be able to display
    long long integers with printf on Win32. This change is also necessary
    to avoid segfaults when debug is enabled in vlc on Win32.

  - few minor changes in the directx plugins.

  - defined snprintf in common.h and removed a few #ifdef WIN32

2001-07-07 Saturday 17:45  sam

   * Probably fixed the "X eats more and more CPU" bug. Please test.
   * mingw32 cross-compilation issue fixed.

2001-07-06 Friday 08:43  sam

   * Small optimization in vpar_blocks.c, sparing a few memset() calls.
   * Additional error checking in vout_sdl.c.
   * Minor manpage fix, conforming to Debian policy version 3.5.5.0
     (Closes Debian bug #99561).

2001-07-01 Sunday 08:49  gbazin

 - Portablility fix: We now control the name to be used in the assembler
     code for a C function or variable.
     GCC for Win32 normally prepends an underscore to the name of a
     C function or variable, and the inline assembler code was using the
     name without the underscore so we had undefined symbols in some
     modules.
 - Reenabled all the accelerated modules on Win32.

2001-06-28 Thursday 22:12  gbazin

 - a few bug fixes for the directx plugin.
 - removed the custom usleep function for win32 as we don't really need
     this accuracy, and it was eating cpu resources.

2001-06-27 Wednesday 09:53  massiot

 Elementary Stream input plugin (use it with --input es). Only works with
 video streams at the moment.

2001-06-27 Wednesday 06:29  gbazin

 - Added command line option '--stdout <filename>' which redirects stdout
     and stderr to the specified file. This option should mainly be useful
     on Win32.
 - On Win32, vlc now has an icon associated to the .exe file, and is a full
     GUI application (you don't have this annoying dos command box anymore)
 - Added INSTALL-win32.txt for specific details to the Win32 port.

 I've tested these changes on Win32 and Linux, let's hope I didn't break
   vlc for other platforms.

2001-06-15 Friday 05:12  sam

   * Unrolled two loops in dvd_netlist.c to prevent flooding.
   * DVD input stuttering fix by Jon Lech Johansen.

2001-06-14 Thursday 20:21  sam

   * Added gprof profiling support with --enable-profiling.

     It works at last! configure with --enable-profiling, build, run
  vlc (you may want to add --noaudio, it currently segfaults with sound
  here) and launch "gprof vlc" when finished.

     To make gprof work with multithreaded programs, one needs to set the
  internal ITIMER_PROF timer for each new thread launched. I did this
  through a wrapper in vlc_thread_create (see include/threads.h).

2001-06-14 Thursday 02:47  sam

   * Fully working Windows DVD ioctl support by Jon Lech Johansen.
   * Usual weekly ChangeLog mass-update.

2001-06-14 Thursday 01:49  sam

   * DirectX enhancements by Gildas Bazin, such as software rendering.
   * Merged dvdcss_init and dvdcss_open into dvdcss_open, and dvdcss_close
     and dvdcss_end into dvdcss_close. libdvdcss API now has 7 functions.
   * Another failed attempt at profiling vlc under Linux: ported the
     threads API to GNU Pth. Activate with --enable-pth. It doesn't seem to
     spawn new threads for me, maybe someone will have better luck.
   * Makefile optimizations.
   * Automatic build of libdvdcss if not found.

2001-06-13 Wednesday 00:03  stef

 *the dvd netlist no longer stops when the fifo is empty ; it just waits
 that there are free vectors again

2001-06-12 Tuesday 22:14  sam

   * Exported the CSS part of the dvd plugin into a library.

2001-06-12 Tuesday 18:16  stef

 *slight modification in input_dvd since Getiovec wasn't at the right
 place

 *send escape packet when changing title, not to be stuck in some
 decoder.

 *the position in the title is now resetted when we change title to
 prevent a title from being unavailable because we're stuck at the end

 *fixed a bug with 1-chapter-long title that displayed chapter 0.

 *added a _temporary_ field in p_main to know whether the audio stream is
 ac3 (ugly). It allows a vlc launched in spdif mode to play mpeg or lpcm
 audio.

 *cleaned the title property messages to get rid of the ugly stars.

2001-06-12 Tuesday 13:50  henri

 Added LPCM support. It should work with stereo LPCM.
 Untested with 5-ways LPCM streams.

2001-06-12 Tuesday 00:30  reno

 * Check that OS support SSE optimization for PIII (to avoid illegal hardware instruction on Linux 2.2.x)

2001-06-09 Saturday 17:01  stef

 *Fixed a bug in synchro reinitialisation: we no longer have a shift each
 time we restart the synchro (for scr discontinuity for instance)

 *In DVD mode, we reinit the synchro only if the scr are not continuous
 (instead of each cell)

 *Try to improve ac3 spdif to prevent from desynchronization.

   * Lots of DirectX plugin fixes by Gildas Bazin.
   * Compilation fix in message queue mode.

2001-06-07 Thursday 15:27  sam

   * Applied old FreeBSD patch for dvd input by German Tischler.
   * Found what was causing the slowdowns: a namespace collision. Put all
     plugins into builtins again.

2001-06-07 Thursday 01:10  sam

   * Put most builtins in plugins again due to performances issues (more
     about this in a forthcoming post here).
   * Fixed the painfully slow build process (at last!).
   * Moved the null plugin together with the dummy one.
   * Added new dummy input plugin.

    More on the dummy input plugin: we'll use it to insert commands in
   the playlist. Currently implemented are the "quit" and "pause" functions,
   here are examples on how they are used:

     vlc file.mpeg vlc:quit                # exit after file.mpeg has been read.

     vlc file1.mpeg vlc:pause:3 file2.mpeg # pause 3 seconds before playing
                                           # the next file.

    From now we can more efficiently benchmark vlc. For instance, to test
   the video output changes I am doing, I use such a command:

     time vlc -I dummy --noaudio file.mpeg vlc:quit

    Future extentions might include more interesting stuff like "switch
   to full screen", "repeat next file 3 times", "switch to SDL video
   output"...

   * DirectX plugin by Gildas Bazin <gbazin@netcourrier.com>.

     Notes: o I called it 'directx' instead of 'windx' because it
              made a lot more sense to me.
            o Completely untested. I didn't manage to compile it yet.
            o Code in vout_directx.c will go through a big rewrite when
              vout 4 is finished. Xav is already working on this.

   * Hrmpf. Forgot the most important file.

2001-05-30 Wednesday 17:03  sam

   * Fixed the BeOS compile typo.
   * The ALSA plugin is back.
   * A gift for Gildas: plugins don't rely on backlinking any more. The
     drawback is the dirty magic in include/modules_export.h which has to
     be included whenever a module needs one of the functions in it. But
      a) we should less and less rely on those functions
      b) no plugin code modification was needed

    The BeOS and MacOS X modules may be broken when compiled as plugins,
    I'll check this later when I can reboot under BeOS.

 -Changes and bugfixes to make network work in VLAN Broadcast mode.

 -Bugfix in the interface to access the network specific features.

 -Some base of synchro in ac3 spdif

2001-05-28 Monday 04:23  sam

   * Added a wrapper for readv() on platforms which don't support it. The
     network support now compiles under Win32, but still doesn't work, the
     select in plugins/mpeg/input_ts.c never returns any data.

     Is there anything like strace(1) under Win32 to debug this ?

2001-05-28 Monday 03:17  xav

 Modified in order to add network input under Win32.
 It compiles under Linux and Win32 (yeeaaahaaa, haven't broken anything
 :-))
 (added the WinSock library initialization and cleanup)
 Could someone test if it does really function ?

2001-05-28 Monday 02:54  sam

   * Of course my Win32 patch broke the Un*x version.

   * Fixed a warning for *BSD compilation.
   * Fixed a typo in yesterday's Darwin ioctl fixes.
   * Patch by Eugenio so that the OS X interface and video output handle the
     aout and vout banks.

2001-05-25 Friday 04:23  sam

   OS X fixes:

   * Applied Eugenio's fix to the DVDioctl driver. I didn't test it, but
     it should not hang the kernel anymore.

   * Ported most dvd_ioctl.c functions to the DVDioctl driver: ReportAgid,
     ReportChallenge, ReportKey1, ReportASF, InvalidateAgid, SendChallenge,
     SendKey2. They should comply with the "Mt. Fuji Commands for Multimedia
     Devices" paper.

     Last remaining problem: ReadCopyright and ReadKey. The version of
  Darwin I have here only has reportKey() and sendKey() functions in
  the IODVDBlockStorageDevice class (pages 413 and 449 of the Mt. Fuji
  paper), but we also need the READ_STRUCTURE (page 357) which I couldn't
  find anywhere in the kernel headers. Either I missed it, or we'll have
  to wait for Apple to implement it (or maybe we can emulate this command
  with some other IOKit commands).

 -A little bug with lpcm in Makefile

2001-05-23 Wednesday 23:08  stef

 -Unification of gnome/gtk intefaces: now all the file are in plugin/gtk.

 Specific files are glade generated files and intf_* files. All the
 remainders are common to gtk and gnome and contain all the callbacks for
 both interfaces.

2001-05-23 Wednesday 17:47  stef

 -LPCM audio selection in ps mode, in prevision of henri's decoder.

2001-05-19 Saturday 00:39  stef

 *More cleanification in gtk interface: now to change the
 title/chapter/audio/spu/angle, we tell the input to do intead of doing
 it inside the interface. It results in fewer locks during the changes.

 *The dvd plugin reads again blocks of 32 sectors to gain speed since
 there are no more lock-ups during stream change. I've also created a new
 file that contain function to described video and audio streams with ifo
 datas.

 The changes are made only for gtk. We should update the other interfaces
 soon (beos at least).

 There is a memory corruption somewhere that make the vlc crash. I've no
 idea where to search.

 *added a b_stopped flag to interface playlist to have a stop function in
 interface plugins. As a consequence, the playlist no longer loops on end
 but wait for the user to press 'play' or to add another item (gtk/gnome
 interface). I think that other plugins are broken but it shouldn't be
 difficult to repair: just add a 'p_main->p_playlist->b_stopped = 0' in
 play functions and 'p_main->p_playlist->b_stopped = 1' when you have to
 stop.

 *Updated gtk interface so that it has the same features as gnome. I
 think I will merge the code so that we don't have to copy and paste each
 change. Only the .glade file would be different.

   * Added support for some terribly braindead DVD subtitles in Kenshin
     which do not have a "stop display" command. Anime fans rejoice!
   * Fixed the BeOS interface to use p_aout_bank instead of p_main->p_aout.
   * Coding-style butchery (mostly tabs).

2001-05-07 Monday 03:14  stef

 *Changed the level arg in intf_WarnMsg so that it is more logical: the
 level corresponds now to the nb of -v to display the message.

 *added functionnal preference window in gnome: it changes the
 envirronment variables

 *added jump window in gnome to jump to a precise time.

2001-05-06 Sunday 18:32  stef

 *Much work on the gnome interface: added oct's playlist from gtk plugin,
 tuned appearence, added preferences window (with no features yet), jump
 window to go to specified time (not functionnal yet), and fixed some
 bugs.

 *moved b_fullscreen from p_vout->p_sys to p_vout and unified way of
 toggling fullscreen in sdl in x11/xvideo output (using p_vout->i_ch
 nges) so that an interface plugin can toogle fullscreen (implemented
 in gnome)

 *added p_input->stream.p_selected_area->i_tell in input TS so that the
 slider work with ts files ( however, the time counter doesn't since we
 have no mux_rate )

 *improved ac3 spdif output ( and made it work again :)). It uses a true
 blank frame now, and it allows to switch languages like a traditionnal
 output. It doesn't support multiplexing though, neither can we switch
 between spdif/analogical mode on-the-fly.

 *beginning of the back port of gnome to gtk for those who do not have
 gnome.

2001-05-06 Sunday 04:32  sam

   * Fixed a few warnings with gcc 3.0.
   * aout and vout are now allocated in banks, making it possible to have
     several of them at the same time.
   * configure now checks for MMX and MMX EXT support in the assembler.
   * Removed all MMX code from the main program and moved it to the
     existing idct modules (Closes: Debian bug #96036).

     Don't forget to make distclean before building vlc again.

2001-05-02 Wednesday 20:01  sam

   * Fixed a remaining buffer overflow in the Gnome interface and applied
     the patches to the Gtk+ interface.

2001-05-01 Tuesday 12:22  sam

   * Fixed a segfault in the SPU decoder initialization.

2001-05-01 Tuesday 04:18  sam

   * Mandatory step for video output IV and the audio output quality
     fix: the output threads are now spawned when a decoder needs one,
     so it can decide the audio frequency or the video window size. Still
     under heavy construction, so don't get too excited at finding bugs
     in it yet.

     Note: this change broke the XVideo module, so I made its score much
     lower than before. I suspect xvideo.so had a bug before which only
     appears now. Other video output plugins may be broken as well, but
     again this might be due to old existing bugs showing their ugly head.

   * Fixed a few buffer overflows in the Gnome interface.
   * The module bank is now a global variable. The video output bank and
     the audio output bank might follow (when they exist).
   * Coding style and organization fixes to the spdif decoder.
   * autoconf and Makefile changes by Arnaud Gomes-do-Vale
     <arnaud@carrosse.frmug.org>.

 Such a thing is necessary for dvd playback at cell change ; however,
 Meuuh, could you look at that since you might think we should do
 otherwise.

 cards: it sends raw ac3 frames to an external ac3 decoder. It is very
 experimental yet, hasn't any synchro ... but it works well with my

 Re-added the new packet allocation method in PS input, using packet caches.
 With warning level 1, you can see when a packet is allocated or freed; the
 goal is to never call 'malloc' nor 'free', except at the beginning of the
 stream.
 The size of the different caches can be adjusted in plugins/mpeg/input_ps.h.
 If 'free' is called too often, it means that a cache is too small, so try
 to increase its size.

   * Built-in modules support almost finished.

     Now you can compile any module within vlc, even the Gnome, Qt, SDL
   and GGI modules at the same time, resulting in an awful extra fat
   vlc binary with gazillons of library dependecies.

     The only exception is that the Gnome and Gtk+ modules can't be
   compiled together into vlc. But you can have one compiled built-in
   and the other as a plugin.

     Another consequence is that libdl should no longer be needed under
   MacOS X. I'll check this as soon as possible.

   * A few Makefile fixes for BeOS
   * XVideo patches by Shane Harper

2001-04-15 Sunday 04:19  sam

   * Beginning of the built-in modules support.

    A few words about the changes:

   - heavy Makefile butchery has taken place, each plugin now has its own
     Makefile. I know recursive make blablah harmful, but it was just so
     much easier to do this way.

   - Makefile.in has disappeared, we now generate Makefile.opts with
     the overall configuration options, and Makefile.modules which is
     specific to module compilation.

   - After ./configure has been run you may want to modify Makefile.opts
     to check which modules will be compiled built-in or as plugins.

   - Some modules cannot be compiled built-in right now because proper
     linkage doesn't work yet. We don't really care since they're the
     interface or video output modules. The most important stuff works
     (iDCT, motion, YUV, input).

   - It's perfectly valid to compile a module both as built-in and as a
     plugin. vlc will only load the built-in one, but I'll add an option
     to ignore built-in modules for testing purposes.

   - We *should* see a performance increase here. I didn't have much time
     to test it, but if anyone can confirm and perhaps give a rough
     estimate of how much we gain...

 Forgot a little thing...main.  Done for now I hope;-)

2001-04-11 Wednesday 13:56  ej

 Fixed a dumb mistake in Makefile.in

2001-04-11 Wednesday 13:30  ej

 Updated & cleaned up intf_macosx.c and vout_macosx.c - added Open menu
 function support and a no-frills About box

 Created macosx_common.h in plugins/macosx/ to hold , well, common stuff
 (the way I see it, there is inherently a difficult separation of intf and
 vout on Mac OS, if anyone has suggestions I'm open)

 Cleaned up debug spew I left in modules.c and video_text.c

 Hacked main.c to disregard argv[1] when compiled for OSX & run as a full
 app (ie., double clicked and not launched from command line)... read the
 file for more details.  UGLY.

 Updated Makefile.in to make vlc.app by default on Mac OS X & Darwin, added
 clean code for it as well

2001-04-11 Wednesday 12:52  sam

   * Fixed icons location and Debian desktop menus.

2001-04-11 Wednesday 04:31  sam

   * Removed deprecated stuff from config.h.
   * Disabled message queue by default.
   * A few other changes in the CSS code, the BeOS issues should be fixed.
   * Fixed a memory leak in gtk_callbacks.c (thanks to Dae).

 - Ported the 0.2.0's channel changing functions
 - Cosmetic changes : the word 'vlan' is disappearing

   with our channel server. Nitrox should fix this within a week.
 - X and Xv output : added autohide cursor as in SDL
 - X and Sv : keys 1 to 0 change channel
 - SDL : keys F1 to F10 change channel as I was not able to make 1..0 work

2001-04-10 Tuesday 17:47  stef

2001-04-05 Thursday 16:37  asmax

 switched back to the old packet allocation method for PS input, because
 Sam does not want the new one ;)

2001-04-05 Thursday 14:00  asmax

 Added a new packet allocation method that punish one's mother in PS input.
 I hope there won't be too many segfaults because of it ;)
 A few parameters must be adjusted to optimize this method; I'll do it later
 because Proba Stat sucks ;)

2001-04-05 Thursday 03:50  sam

   * added the GNU getopt library, which gets compiled in when getopt_long
     isn't available on the desired platform.
   * replaced the `--warning' flag with the standard cumulative `-v' flag.
     `-v' is like `--warning 3', and `-vvvv' is like `--warning 0'
     (`--warning' is still valid for those used to it)
   * cleaning in configure.in and Makefile.in, the Solaris port now
     builds and runs properly.

2001-04-03 Tuesday 03:39  stef

 -Fall back to one-packet-once reading in dvd input since multi-block
 seems to have a bug that make the vlc crash on title/audio/spu change. I
 hope that this bug will be fixed soon for the performance is poorer now

 -add-ons and changes in gnome interface:
         *menu subdivision is done only if there are over 20 items,
         *in DVD mode next/prev apply to title,
         *in DVD mode, added a box with button to navigate through
          chapters.
 This has not been finished yet (and it is not in gtk plugin then). And I
 think I will leave toolbar next/prev buttons for playlist and add
 button specifically for title change like for chapters.*

2001-04-02 Monday 23:30  sam

  * fixes for the Qt plugin compilation under Debian

  * heavy butchering in the CSS and DVD ioctl code to put all architecture-
    dependent code in dvd_ioctl.c

  * added almost fully-functional /dev/dvd driver for MacOS X in
    extras/DVDioctl; to build it:

     % cd extras/DVDioctl
     % pbxbuild
     % kextload build/DVDioctl.kext # note: kextload has to be run as root

    be aware that the license for the DVDioctl kernel extension is
    not GPL but APSL, because I borrowed some code from the Darwin kernel.

2001-04-01 Sunday 07:31  stef

 -Various bug fixes in dvd_netlist. Some bugs seem to remain though.
 -New function input_ToggleES for interaction with interface.

    * SDL fixes and enhancements by Shane Harper <shanegh@optusnet.com.au>

    Shane, I removed the static variables from your code because static
    is not thread-safe, and one can imagine having several video output
    windows launched at the same time. Also, I made your feature work
    in windowed mode as well, because people kept asking how to hide the
    mouse pointer.

    Also, if you want to work on the XVideo extension, you are welcome ;
    most of us are quite busy at the moment. Damien Lucas <nitrox@via.ecp.fr>
    had offered to work on it, but he seems to be a bit lost, so you may
    want to take over his job.

    As for the "zoom" feature, I suggest you wait until version 4 of the
    video output is done, it'll be easier to do then.

 Regards,

2001-03-20 Tuesday 20:54  massiot

   * Bug fixes and enhancements in the Gtk+/Gnome interfaces.

    o the slider should behave correctly and stop jumping here and
      there (this bug is _not_ related to Stef's similar bug)
    o added an "open network" menu (useless since the input doesn't
      handle it properly yet)
    o tried to reorganize gnome_callbacks.c and gtk_callbacks.c
    o stream date is now displayed instead of percentage
    o renamed gnome_sys.h to intf_gnome.h, and gtk_sys.h to intf_gtk.h

   * Changed documentation and package creation files.

    o added versioned conflicts/replaces to vlc-gtk (Closes Debian bug #88796)
    o removed useless or outdated documentation from doc/*
    o moved vlc.1 manpage from debian/vlc.1 to doc/vlc.1

   * Added basic Qt interface.

    o working features: slide bar, open file, toolbar, popup menu
    o added "qvlc" alias, equivalent to "vlc -I qt"
    o known issues : no "open disc" or "open network" menus yet
                     the IntfWindow class is never cleaned on destruction
                     the popup menu always pop at the middle of the screen

   * Misc fixes/updates.

    o renamed netutils.h functions from input_* to network_*
    o renamed *plst* files and functions to *playlist* (it was stupid
      from me to name them "plst")
    o made a few input error messages more meaningful
    o added -I, -A and -V short flags, corresponding to --intf, --audio
      and --video

     I got a lot of conflicts on this commit, lart me if I forgot a
   file or made old bugs reappear.

 interface.

 It is a bit buggy yet, and some pieces of code need to change,
 especially to handle better menus change when title change but it
 eventually works.

   * Disabled network input under BeOS so that it compiles again. We'll
     have to wait for BONE anyway.

2001-03-07 Wednesday 00:18  henri

 - Fixed TS input ( a nasty dead lock had appeared 4 days ago )
 - Added base of network support

 Things to be done :
 - Meuuh : fix the PCR synchronisation so that we can set b_pace_cntrol to 0
 - Sam : find a way of specifing the type of media (file, net). For the
 moment, the "--input ts" always call input_NetworkOpen
 - Maybe sam : for the moment the working syntax is vlc --input ts
 servername, it should nbe turned into "vlc --server servername".

 Things that don't work (i'll work on this this week end) :
 - stopping and retaking a stream
 - a nice 'waiting for stream'
 - we select all incoming streams. we should be able to select.

 Things that haven't been tested :
 - broadcast
 - only tested with one stream.

 Kick me if something is broken by my fault.

 -New function for DVD reading, that is able to read multiple blocks
 (I've chosen 32 now), that doesn't use any memcpy anymore and is also much
 faster. It is ready now for cell positioning in multi-angle DVD (to come
 soon).

 -DVD specific netlist adapted to 2048 bytes long blocks that contain
 several data_packets.

 -Modification in mpeg_system.c to use p_payload_start instead of
 p_buffer (necessary for DVD plugin). It does not break other plugins
 since they set p_payload_start to p_buffer

 -New field i_read_once in input_thread_s to be able to read more than
 the TS related 7 packets ; i_read_once is set to INPUT_READ_ONCE by
 defaults but plugins can change it during initialisation.

 Please check that nothing is broken :)

2001-02-28 Wednesday 05:20  sam

   * Additional optimizations to the subtitle decoder
   * The GGI video output should now be faster. Also, right-mouse-clicking
     works in GGI mode as well.

2001-02-26 Monday 17:41  sam

   * Optimizations done to the SPU decoder. Now the RLE is expanded at
     decoding time, not rendering time. The main loop in vout_RenderSPU
     is now 20 lines long.

2001-02-26 Monday 12:16  sam

   * The Gtk+ interface is now built as a Debian package as well. The Gnome
     package depends on it because of the icon and menu entry.
   * Added an intf_WarnHexDump() function to do raw hexadecimal dumps of
     memory areas. For debugging purposes or for real men, as you wish.
   * Lots of tidying in dvd_ioctl.c, a few comments added.
   * Better error handling in the subpicture decoder.
   * Tidied video_spu.c. More to come later.
   * Fixed subtitle displaying. Will soon work in overlay mode as well.

   (note: empty CVS mails mean that a new directory has been created,
    don't forget to use the -p option if you cvs update)

   * Added a plain Gtk+ port of the Gnome interface, for the gnome-impaired
     people. Gtk+ is now compiled by default, while Gnome isn't (you will
     have to add --enable-gnome when running configure)
   * Replaced -lcurses with -lncurses in configure.in.

2001-02-21 Wednesday 04:38  henri

 TS Input :
 - Added DemuxPSI, DecodePAT and DecodePMT. Never tested which streams
   where PAT or PMT are splitted in more than one section.

 Todo :
 - What if data get unaligned ?
 - Write NetworkOpen
 - Try to find why I get no sound on matrix.ts
 - Support Stream and program selection.

   * Fixed a similar bug in src/video_output/video_text.c.
   * BeOS CSS support, thanks to Markus Kuespert <ltlBeBoy@beosmail.com>
     who ported the Linux DVD ioctls. We can now read encrypted DVDs
     under BeOS ! Woohoo.

  First serie of changes in DVD module for the forthcoming interface menus
  There is a new capability in input type modules for setting the
 attributes of a new area. It is set to NULL for PS and TS plugins.
  It should be called for every title change, chapter change,
 audio mode change or spu channel change.

 But this part of code is not used at the moment, and is not completed
 yet.

2001-02-19 Monday 03:12  stef

 -Change in the code to detect beginning of movie. It is much better now
 but still fails with some DVD for which the movie is not the first
 Program.

 As a consequence some DVD that worked before don't work anymore.

 -Beginning of ideas to handle chapters and ES selection

   * configure.in and Makefile.in patches for better SDL support and
     support for $(bindir) $(datadir) and $(libdir) stuff, courtesy
     of Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <misiek@pld.ORG.PL>
   * Ported ggi.so to the new modules API. As for the other modules, only
     the "q" key works. Moreover, VLC doesn't exit cleanly if you close the
     GGI window.
   * Deactivated non-working widgets in the Gnome interface.
   * Added CONTRIBUTORS file.

   Hint of the day: don't expect to code quite long in your bed when sleepy.

2001-02-18 Sunday 10:24  sam

  * Ported the framebuffer plugin to the new module API. As for most of the
    other video output modules, keyboard doesn't work. Except ^C to quit.

    The BeOS port seems to work again.

    I used this command to play an unencrypted DVD, but maybe there is a
    better solution: ./vlc dvd:/dev/disk/ide/atapi/1/master/0/raw

    Current problems: gcc doesn't like MMX-EXT instructions, and refuses
    to have register %ebx being used in the main application. Grr.

 -UDF filesystem support so that we know the location of the first video
 related file with 100% reliability (great change that should make DVDs
 with binaries and extra stuff work with vlc).

 -Correction of a bug in ifo reading that falsified the adress of
 video titles.

 -Changed the method for selecting title at start. It is _not_ reliable
 though, but it is better than the preceding one.

2001-02-17 Saturday 08:48  sam

  * Tried to fix the BeOS interface and video output. Any BeOS developers
    listening ? I can't even test that code, it probably wants additional
    fixing.
  * Added a workaround in modules.c for broken libc's which happen to truncate
    filenames in dentry structures when using 64bits offsets. The kind of
    stuff you only see in RedHats <g>.
  * Made the SDL error messages a bit more useful.
  * The Gnome menu is now created when mouse is released, not when it
    is pressed. It may sound stupid, but it really makes a difference.

2001-02-16 Friday 09:25  sam

  * Upgraded version number to 0.2.61. Release is today.

  * Fixed package building (both RPMs and .debs).
  * Fixed `make snapshot' rule.
  * Added some magic to filename detection. To read a DVD you now just
    need to run 'vlc dvd:/dev/hdc' for instance. Same for file:// URIs.
  * Fixed a segfault in the slider when no stream was playing.
  * Made the slider go from 0 to 100 (instead of 99 :)
  * The vlc now doesn't exit when finished playing. As a side effect of
    the playlist code being very recent, it continuously loops.

2001-02-16 Friday 06:37  sam

  * Fixed a segfault in the input thread creation, as well as a possible
    deadlock. This happened mostly when opening non-existing files.
  * Created input_SetStatus to do input_SetRate's job. input_SetRate will
    be used to set an arbitrary rate, for people who want to read DVDs at
    1/2.71828 times the actual speed.
  * Stubs for the ncurses control interface. No working code yet, but the
    holes just need to be filled.
  * Improved X11 support. Still not as functional as before.
  * The output window now states the method name, so that people know whether
    they are using X11 or SDL.
  * The Gnome interface is now drag'n'drop aware, you can drop a file
    on it just like Xine does (or so I guess).

2001-02-15 Thursday 03:01  sam

  * X11 output works again. It's just the output, but it works; I now need
    to clean the code and add event handling.

2001-02-14 Wednesday 15:58  henri

 Begining of TS Input

 Done :
 - fixed netlist
 - embryo : support TS video trough file ( kludgy ... )

 Next :
 - Write DecodePSI and DemuxPSI, wich will clean the kludges off

 Then :
 - Write NetworkOpen ( shouldn't be difficult )

 Eventually :
 - Deal with lost/corrupt packets

2001-02-14 Wednesday 14:31  sam

  * Should have fixed the dependency generater for some plugins.

2001-02-14 Wednesday 07:48  sam

  * updated version information to 0.2.60 -- today's release
  * started porting the X11 vout (still disabled)
  * a few unnoticeable changes in the Gnome intf

2001-02-13 Tuesday 04:29  sam

  * added --intf option to vlc
  * started cleaning vout_sdl.c
  * the dummy plugin works again
  * added a slider to the Gnome interface so that we can browse through streams

   There is a problem with the slider: we sometimes get unexpected async
   replies, which would mean that we don't properly lock our Xlib calls.
   Which is true. But we also get these errors when using `--vout dummy'.
   I'll investigate.

2001-02-12 Monday 13:20  massiot

 * We can now seek at position 0 :p ;
 * Fixed a typo in my previous commit.

2001-02-12 Monday 11:22  massiot

 * Tried to enhance picture dating on timebase discontinuities.

2001-02-12 Monday 09:39  sam

  . removed tests against i_rate and i_new_rate calculation from the
    plugins and hid this complexity into input_ext-intf.c

2001-02-12 Monday 07:52  sam

   * Fixed my old stupid bug that disabled sound after having played the
     first playlist item.
   * Added `Prev' and `Next' buttons to the interface, with the beginning of
     a playlist window (still empty).
   * Added `Slow' and `Fast' buttons to the interface and popup menu.

   Ok, I promise it's the last time I check bloat in, from now the interface
   commits will be much cleaner and actually fix things :)

2001-02-12 Monday 00:20  sam

  * The pure Gnome part of the Gnome interface has been rewritten from
    scratch, and the .glade file included as well. You can edit it by
    installing glade-gnome and doing `glade plugins/gnome/intf_gnome.glade',
    or directly by hand if you grok XML.
  * Files can now be loaded into vlc using the `Open' buttons. But for the
    moment you still have to launch vlc with at least one file, because it
    quits when the end of the playlist is reached.
  * Idle screen was disabled because it eats a lot of CPU and is mostly
    useless for the moment. And it gets activated when pause lasts for too
    long.

2001-02-11 Sunday 01:15  sam

   Beginning of Interface II
  ---------------------------

  * Plugins have completely disappeared, we now only use the new module API.
  * All intf and vout modules are now independant. So far, only the Gnome
    intf module and the SDL vout module have been ported. configure.in has
    been modified to reflect the changes (x11 and dummy aren't compiled by
    default anymore, while SDL and Gnome are).

   Note that this is _not_ Interface II, it's just a step forward. For
   instance, it lacks the whole message passing scheme.

   Things that should work:

  * Right-clicking on the SDL video output window brings the Gnome menu.
  * Pause, Play, Exit, About work from the menu or from the interface window.
  * The old SDL keys still work.

    Things that are broken or may be broken:

  * Xlib calls are not locked yet, which may lead to "Unexpected async reply"
    errors, and make the vlc segfault.
  * Sound only works for the first file.
  * The SDL vout_sdl.c file is absolutely ugly and kludgey.
  * The vlc immediately quits when no filename is given as an argument. Not
    a real bug, but still annoying.
  * The Gnome menu does not work in fullscreen mode.

    Things that will come soon, maybe tomorrow:

  * Complete navigation buttons (fast forward, slow, etc.).
  * File/Open menu to add files to the playlist.
  * Return of the X11 video output for those of us who do not have SDL.
  * Textmode interface for those of us who do not have Gnome.
  * aout and vout autospawn (maybe).

2001-02-09 Friday 03:51  stef

 -Some functions to prepare ifo commands utilisation to move in the
 structures of DVDs
 -Change in configure to avoid compiling css functions on BSD.

2001-02-08 Thursday 23:40  sam

  . added comments to src/interface/intf_plst.c and include/intf_plst.h

  . updated the TODO list (34 items to do, 41 done !)

2001-02-08 Thursday 17:44  massiot

 * Portability : changed off64_t to off_t and activated appropriate
   GNU/Linux options ;
 * Changed fseek() to fseeko() for 64-bit offsets ;
 * Reset frame predictors on a stream discontinuity.

2001-02-08 Thursday 13:52  massiot

 * Implemented basic stream navigation function, and bound Jump forward
   and jump Backward in the SDL intf. Enjoy !

2001-02-08 Thursday 13:08  massiot

 * Pause function implemented ('p' key).

2001-02-08 Thursday 07:24  sam

  . moved the playlist handling from input/input.c to interface/interface.c
  . fixed a few warnings at compile-time
  . fixed sound channel selection in playlist mode
  . added a color message in the plugin bank because on peut bien dconner
    cinq minutes, quand-mme
  . we now spawn a new input thread for each file
  . added a missing pf_close() because it's always cool to close files
    after we read them

2001-02-08 Thursday 06:41  stef

 -solved bug with cssdescrambling. The vlc might segfault with dvd
 plugins. I will fix that soon.
 -minor modification in pluginification.

2001-02-08 Thursday 04:43  sam

    This commit is a bit early, but it'll save Stef, Henri and me much
  time later, when we don't have to backport modifications to input_*.c

    What's new :
     - playlist works again (still the old wrong way like Meuuh doesn't
     like, but this is going to change within a few hours)
     - input_ps, input_ts and input_dvd are now plugins, located in
     plugins/mpeg/ and plugins/dvd/

    What's broken :
     - audio output might be broken on some streams ; have to investigate

    What has changed :
     - fast/slow keys are now A/Z instead of A/S since S was already
     linked to the scale/noscale toggle.
     - `--dvd' doesn't work anymore, for the moment try to use :
      vlc --input dvd /dev/dvd
     - module bank is now less verbose ; use `--warn 1' to turn back
     verbosity on

2001-02-08 Thursday 01:34  stef

 -New method using netlist to read packets on DVD device by sectors of
 2048 bytes.
 -Some modifications in netlist to make it work with DVD.
 -Fixed  bug in mpeg_system.c

 We use INPUT_READ_ONCE many times in the input code. I think that
 we should replace it with a field in input_thread_t to give more
 flexibility to modules. I have done it in DVD plugin but it can't work
 if input.c is limited by INPUT_READ_ONCE.

 The DVD method is slower than input_ps ; but there are things to
 improve.
 CSS descrambling is broken.

2001-02-08 Thursday 00:46  reno

 We can now choose the speed of forward (between 32/1 and 1/8)

 * Dirty hack in the SDL intf to bind "a" (fAst forward), "s" (Slow motion)
 and "p" (Play).

2001-02-07 Wednesday 15:32  massiot

 * Centralized clock management, preparing for stream navigation ;

 . Used instead p_vout->i_changes like in x11

2001-02-05 Monday 21:00  sam

  . disabled SDL parachute to let the vlc dump a core instead of staying stuck
  . patched 2 debian bugs

  . improved the snapshot generation

2001-02-04 Sunday 03:06  sam

  . removed obsolete video_yuv_mmx.S
  . updated the TODO list and wrote a small todo.pl parser to make it
    easier to see which items remain to be done
  . `make snapshot' now creates vlc-*.tar.gz and vlc-*-nocss.tar.gz

2001-01-31 Wednesday 03:42  sam

  . version 0.2.50 for the Linux Expo
  . --overlay and --fulscreen options (only work with --vout sdl)
  . the vlc exits after the end of the stream, which prevents from having
    to kill it and relaunch it during a presentation, just script it like :

       for i in ~/mpeg/* ; do vlc --fullscreen --overlay --vout sdl $i ; done

  Yes, I know the --overlay stuff is fucking ugly. But *I* am not the one
   who redefines vout_sys_t in an interface-related source file. I won't
   change it until the vout/intf is finished being rewritten.

  Additional information: if "--overlay --fulscreen" doesn't center your
   picture, try with your screen geometry, eg:
   "--overlay --fullscreen --width 1024 --height 768"

2001-01-31 Wednesday 03:24  sam

  . version 0.2.0 pour la linux expo

2001-01-30 Tuesday 05:48  sam

  . not a very nice hack, but will probably spare us a few user complaints: if
   no -a option is specified, the vlc will play the first audio type it finds,
   so there is no need to specify "-a ac3" for a DVD anymore.

2001-01-29 Monday 06:28  stef

     The motion compensation routines are now modules as well ; choose your
   implementation with `--motion motion', `--motion motionmmx' or
   `--motion motionmmxext'. Of course, the best implementation is chosen
   if you don't ask for any. There doesn't seem to be any performance hit
   due to the move to shared libs, which is a good thing. Please test
   actively if you have time, though.

     Updated --help result, manpage, INSTALL document, and a few files.

     I moved vdec_motion.h and vpar_blocks.h back to /include because they
   will be needed to build motion compensation modules, but perhaps we don't
   need to export everything which is in these files.

     /src/video_decoder/ now has only one .c file, perhaps it could now be
   merged with video_parser ?

2001-01-17 Wednesday 18:17  massiot

 - Added SDL sound support. Sounds a bit laggy sometimes but my streams are ill.
   please try.
 - modified configure.in and all that stuff. Re-run configure
 - SDL audio, video and interface are all part of the same .so now.
 - remove YUV old files :->

 * Reverted something that wasn't supposed to go into the cvs :p
 * Removed -fargument-noalias-global which causes problems with as (???).

 * Borrowed livid's latest libmmx and MMXEXT MC. Not in the Makefile => to

 I'm interested in performance feedback.

2001-01-16 Tuesday 16:09  sam

  . a few changes in the CPU extensions detection code, borrowed from the
    kernel and from mpeg2dec. I still don't know how to detect if code
    compiled with -mcpu=pentiumpro will run, since the cpuid arcanes are
    quite obtuse to me. Perhaps we should also have a way not to load modules
    if they have been compiled with a different CPU to avoid segfaults.

2001-01-16 Tuesday 13:26  sam

  . added files for the SSE (MMX on steroids) IDCT. Meuuh, you should just
    need to touch plugins/idct/idct_mmxext.c (ok, the filenames suck).

2001-01-16 Tuesday 05:04  sam

  [ include/config.h.in has changed, don't forget tu run ./configure ]

  . fixed the --aout, --idct and --yuv flags
  . updated manpage and --(long)help output to reflect that change
  . removed a few unneeded #includes here and there
  . cosmetic changes in error messages in input.c

    Currently available flags are now :

      --aout dummy
             esd
             dsp
             alsa

      --idct idct
             idctclassic
             idctmmx

      --yuv yuv
            yuvmmx

   --vout works like before, but still uses the old plugin system for now.

2001-01-16 Tuesday 04:41  stef

 . Now use of 64 bits offsets to parse the whole DVD. So we have all the
 available information
 . Fixed a bug in parsing of VTS attributes
 . Fixed a bug in input.c that made input plugin initialize even though
 no stream is reachable (thanks Sam)

 I hope I'll be able to get the position of the movie soon.

 Meuuh : the seek function of the plugin now take off_t as argument which
 could be a problem later. Maybe it should take off64_t or time argument.

2001-01-16 Tuesday 02:16  sam

  . merged the YUV plugins in the same directory to avoid too much code
    duplication
  . YUV transformations now use the new module API ; now only the vout
    and interface still depend on the old plugin API
  . changed TestMMX to TestCPU because we will be able to test for other
    specific extensions (3DNow, SSE) for the forthcoming IDCT we'll
    borrow to mpeg2dec (as usual :P)
  . don't show "hiding module" messages anymore except in debug mode
  . swapped C IDCT and Classic IDCT scores since the classic one seems
    to be faster ; anyway you should use the MMX one
  . fixed a Makefile bug under BeOS
  . tried to fix the cpuid code so that it compiles under BeOS (Polux, can
    you test it when you have time ?)

2001-01-15 Monday 08:07  sam

  . there was still a problem upon quitting: sometimes the null packet
    wasn't big enough to reach a decoder breakpoint, so I now create 10
    of them (since I can't make it bigger) to be sure. Meuuh, what do
    you think ?

  . fixed the Makefile to spare a few variables here and there.

  . reduced module hide delay, removed loading of the audio output
    plugins since they are now modules.

  . changed a few intf_Msg to intf_DbgMsg, and added "vout:", "intf:",
    and so on in a few other messages.

  . removed unused includes in the idct modules.

2001-01-15 Monday 03:26  stef

 . Correction of bugs in ifo parsing. Now the structures should be well
 initialized. It remains some segfaults but it globally works.
 . DVD mode is enabled with option --dvd. For the moment, it only read
 the first vts and find the movie if it is at the beginning of the title
 set.

 Coming soon:
 . udf filesystem management to access over 2Gb zones.
 . detection of the offset to the movie inside a vts when it is not at
 the beginning.

 Is there a chance that using fopen/fseek function instead of open/lseek
 system calls solve the 2Gb issue ?

    Note about the IDCT modules: there is no way to choose the one we
    use, but you may remove the module in lib/ to prevent it from being
    loaded. The preference order is : MMX, Optimized, Classic.

 * Fixed 32 bits bitstream bugs.

2001-01-11 Thursday 17:44  sam

   . moved the MPEG audio decoder to the new bitstream

     I wasn't sure whether the bits counting method was effective to
   skip ancillary data at the end of a frame, but I kept it for
   safety. There is still a lot to optimize in the bit counting, like
   unrolling the first iteration of some loops, but I don't know if
   it would be worth it. The other solution would have been to look for
   a startcode after eache frame, without caring about the ancillary bits.

   . cleaning in the SPU decoder.

2001-01-11 Thursday 15:35  sam

  . moved swab32 from input_ext-dec.h to common.h. We probably won't need
    it anymore really soon, since ntohl() and htonl() seem to be properly
    optimized when gcc is passed the right optimization flags.

  . fixed GetBits32 and RemoveBits32. I know the #ifdefs are useless since
    we only support u32 words, but it's a safe reminder. Comments appreciated
    on this fix since I may have b0rked something -- it runs well here though.

2001-01-10 Wednesday 19:22  massiot

 * Changed code for handling b_die in bitstream ;
 * Move input_ext-dec.h to input.h ;
 * New input_NullPacket function ;
 * Fixed init bugs in input and vpar ;

2001-01-10 Wednesday 16:24  massiot

 * Placed a callback to the decoder in the bitstream structure ;
 * Fixed a purify bug in input_ps.c ;
 * Added -mcpu=pentiumpro in the Makefile.

2001-01-10 Wednesday 02:33  sam

  . complete commenting of modules_core.h and small modifications
  . separated MODULE_CONFIG_START and ADD_WINDOW (Henri, beware)
  . fixed a very, very old bug that caused namespace collision between
    plugins (Henri, beware: call your aout_getplugin function like this,
    not alsa_aout_getplugin)
  . removed the Debian specific clean rules from the Makefile, since they
    are already handled by the debian/rules script.
  . tidied a few compilation rules (-lfoo should always be at the end)

2001-01-09 Tuesday 21:03  sam

  . fixed a warning under FreeBSD (dlerror() is a const char*, not a char*).
  . made configure script look for the bswap assembly instruction (using
    AC_TRY_COMPILE makes sure the compiler will really accept it).

2001-01-08 Monday 18:16  sam

  . Added a missing mutex_unlock in video_output.c
  . Moved a mutex_destroy after the thread cancellation to prevent
    possible problems
  . Added a missing #ifdef in intf_msg.c which prevented compilation
    with --enable-debug
  . Fixed a bug in the input that prevented to quit properly in certain
    cases (some ES were not deleted because their index was skipped when
    the former one was deleted, well Meuuh should know what I mean)

   There is still a segfault when quitting, most presumably in the
  audio output. I couldn't find what causes it yet.

2001-01-07 Sunday 17:07  sam

  . added a .cvsignore file in lib/ so that the directory doesn't get
    removed whenever one does a cvs update -dP
  . fixed debian/.cvsignore because of a new version of debhelper

2001-01-07 Sunday 16:17  sam

  . all plugins now compile with -fPIC.

  . made the audio_output API a bit simpler.

  . got rid of modules_config.h.

  . fixed `make install' rule.

  . fixed warnings in the MMX YUV compilation.

  . probably fixed a bug in the input : pp_foo structures were free()d at
    the end, but this was useless since the last call to realloc() is
    equivalent to free(), and two consecutive calls to free() aren't a
    goo idea.

  . we check that the version number match and that we don't already have
    a module by that name when loading a new module.

  . all public module_* functions now properly lock the module bank.

  . the audio_output now uses the new module API ; EsounD and DSP modules
    have been ported, which should be enough for Henri to port the ALSA one.

    The new plugin API is now much simpler ; it's now just a matter of
 calling module_Need( p_main->p_module_bank, MODULE_CAPABILITY_FOO, p_data );
 and if successful we get the best module. Capabilities can be ORed, so that
 one can ask for a plugin that does VOUT _and_ INTF actions for instance.

    It's not complete yet though -- by making it generic I had to do a few
 ugly casts here and there, which I am going to fix ASAP. Also, command line
 selection of a plugin does not work yet.

    The switch to the new plugin API has probably broken the BeOS audio
 output ; we can either wait until the whole vlc has switched to the new
 plugins, or create a separate beos_sound.so that conforms to the new API.

 BSD port, including :
 * --enable-sdl and some others are now --with-sdl[=name] to supply an
 optional library name ;
 * deleted all unnecessary #include <sys/uio.h> ;
 * /usr/include is now searched when looking for libraries and headers.

 It seems to compile and run on BSD. Under Linux Sam's latest commit makes
 vlc crash on startup, so I can't really tell, but hey it compiles.

2001-01-05 Friday 18:06  sam

  . src/misc/modules.c is in a workable state now.

   To test it, run ./configure with the --enable-null flag, which will
   compile the Null Module as a plugin. Watch the memory usage at the
   launch and when the plugin is released.

2001-01-05 Friday 14:46  sam

 (previous commit foired)

  . this is a coding style patch which removes all "foo(bar){" constructions
    and most of the tabulations.
  . also, fixed a bug in the default subtitle track.
  . and made a few error messages more explicit, ie. changed "error: %s" to
    "foo error: couldn't initialize bar (%s)"
  . and removed a warning in intf_ctrl.c which isn't used anyway.

2001-01-05 Friday 14:24  sam

  . added the Null Module, the module that does nothing but that is going
     to be of great help for debugging my module code.

2001-01-05 Friday 13:57  sam

  . Added files needed for the forthcoming module management.

  Notes:

    Plugins are now called modules, because we will be able to compile
    them either as a dynamic plugin, or within the program. And, more
    important, I can commit this without having to break the vlc :)

    I tried to be as clear as possible in my comments, please tell me
    if a few prototypes still have an unclear beahaviour.

    Current features:
     . none, files haven't even been added to the Makefile yet.

    Future features:
     . dynamic loading (done)
     . built-in modules (still to do)
     . automatic unloading of plugins (done)
     . dynamic configuration (still to do)
     . automatic choosing of the most appropriate plugin for a given
        task (still to do but well prepared)

2001-01-04 Thursday 23:18  bozo

2000-08-24 Thursday 14:58  octplane

 Hello,

 Some news things:

  . I am still going on modifiying the key event handling method to make it more flexible. I still have a few things to get what I'd like to
  . added a keystrokes.h include which contains a generic name of all the VLC keys binding
  . modified some of the core interface routines to allow the passing of an extra parameter with a keystroke (VLC_CHANNEL).
  . next step: move all the interface dependent parts (such as the getKey function) to the plugins.

 Hope this will run on your boxes...

2000-08-24 Thursday 00:16  sam

 Added the beos fixes in the ChangeLog.

2000-08-21 Monday 20:05  sam

  . updated version number
  . removed a verbose message in intf_sdl.c

2000-08-21 Monday 19:57  polux

 A lot of bug fixs for the BeOS side of VideoLAN:
 - the vlc does not exhaust system resources anymore (it was creating a new
   mutex each picture so after a while there was no more mutex available in
   the entire system);
 - the sound has been corrected and now it works perfectly;
 - the window has now the right size (there was and additional line before).

 The (BeOS) threads have also been improved especially with the cond vars
 (but it is no more compliant with the pthread cond vars).

 VideoLAN for BeOS now rocks and is ready for its first binary release.

2000-08-21 Monday 16:22  octplane

 .SDL:
 	.removed the YUV thing from the SDL
 	.cleaned up the makefile to remove it
 	.UNTESTED (seems to compile).

2000-08-21 Monday 09:40  octplane

 Plugin handling:
 	. switched low and high order vout plugins
 	. removed yuvsdl plugin.

2000-08-21 Monday 09:33  octplane

 A few new things:

 	. The interface part:
 			. created intf_AssignKey, intf_getKey and intf_AssignNormalKeys
 			these new function are a first abstraction of the the key handling system.			It makes use of a new structure in the interface : p_keys.

 			. AssignNormalKeys is commonly used in all the interface plugins.
 			AssignKey is used to allow the SDL interface to react nicely.

 			. Now the plugin struct element psz_filename is filled (and freed
 				at the end of the program).

 	. the SDL plugin:
 			works but does only display a green screen for now. so don't use it !

 	. Please try and compile the client on your box with this version.
 		I've tried a few output plugin but not all.

 - des performances trs en dessous de celles d'anciennes version du vlc,
 - une synchro son qui ne fonctionne pas correctement,
 - au bout d'un certain temps d'utilisation, toutes les ressources systmes
   sont consommes et le systme lui-mme devient instable (merci d'viter
   les commentaires sur la stabilit de BeOS)

2000-08-08 Tuesday 22:51  sam

  . vir les aliases  xvlc ,  ggivlc  etc. qui faisaient un peu
   piti, pour ne laisser que  vlc ,  gvlc  (gnome) et  fbvlc 
   (framebuffer) ; les autres restent bien entendu accessibles avec
   par exemple  vlc --vout ggi .

  . IMPORTANT - nouvelle option --synchro pour forcer un type de
   synchro. Pour le moment les options possibles sont :

     --synchro I     /* n'affiche que les I */
     --synchro IP    /* affiche les I et toutes les P */
     --synchro IP+   /* affiche les I, les P, et la moiti des B */
     --synchro IPB   /* affiche toutes les images */

    Toute autre valeur de --synchro sera ignore et c'est l'algo
   par dfaut bas sur la consommation de processeur qui sera
   utilis. Notez que si vous en demandez trop au vlc, il va
   bien entendu planter, ou tout du moins remplir sa fifo comme
   un gros cochon. On n'y peut pas grand chose, c'est la vie.

 - Correction du bug de la synchro.
   Le problme provenait d'un dcalage d'une seconde qui avait t rajout
   dans le calcul de la date dans audio_output.c :
   p_aout->date = -1000000 + mdate() + ( (((mtime_t)(l_bytes / 4)) * 1000000)
                                         / ((mtime_t)p_aout->l_rate) );
   C'est le -1000000 qui faisait retarder le son d'exactement une seconde.
   J'aimerais bien savoir pourquoi il a t rajout car peut-tre y-a-t-il
   d'autres bugs similaires qui ne sont pas visibles pour l'instant.

 - Nettoyage d'une partie du code de audio_decoder_thread.c
   Il est vraiment trs dommage que les conventions de codage ne soient pas
   respectes, si il y en a ce n'est pas pour rien. De plus le mlange
   d'espaces et de tabulations rend le code trs peu lisible. Je le
   rappelle, nous n'utilisons que des indentations de 4 espaces et toute
   tabulation est proscrite. Il serait bien de changer le reste du code
   pour qu'il respecte les conventions et reste ainsi facilement lisible
   par tout le monde.

  Bon finalement puisque tout le monde dort, je l'ai fait :)

   . rajout de i_pes_real_size dans la structure p_pes_packet, qui vaut 0
    par dfaut, et est initialis  la taille du payload PES annonce dans
    le header si celle-ci est prsente.
   .  chaque nouveau paquet TS, si i_pes_real_size == i_pes_size on envoie
    directement le PES au dcodeur sans attendre le dbut du PES suivant.
   . cration de input_ParsePES pour y mettre le code dupliqu de
    input_DemuxPES.

  Ca fait 1 test de plus par paquet TS, donc ngligeable. Par contre si
 des gens ayant boss sur l'input ont le temps de vrifier que je n'ai pas
 fait de connerie, a peut tre intressant :)

 Un petit tutorial sur les DCT et DFT... enfin non pas sur leur representation
 "physique" mais plutot sur les differentes methodes de calcul utilisables.

 Ca n'est pas franchement indispensable mais disons que j'ai eu du mal a trouver

 rassembler ce qu'on a...

 J'ai retire gnome du build par defaut afin que ca ne cree pas de probleme
 chez ceux qui n'ont pas les includes appropries...

 Je sais que cette solution n'est pas ideale mais peut on se mettre d'accord
 pour ne construire par defaut que les outputs X et dummy pour la video, et
 dsp et dummy pour l'audio ?

 (a la rigueur si on dit que dans le cvs on ne construit que les dummy je suis
 d'accord aussi)

 ou alors ca sert peut etre a rien de se mettre d'accord et ca sera regle par
 le ./configure bientot ?

 Dbut du portage BeOS. Beaucoup de fuchiers ont t modifi car il a fallu
 rorganiser les headers pour que ce soient les headers les plus proches
 du systme qui se retrouvent en premier (threads.h devrait toujours tre
 le premier des headers non systmes). J'ai du aussi rajouter un type
 plugin_id_t et par la mme occasion inclure plugins.h dans la plupart
 des fichiers. Voici en vrac les modifs les plus importantes que j'ai opr:

 o Lgre rorganisation pour les raisons voques ci-dessus (certaines
   macros comme MIN et MAX peuvent tre dj dfinies par le systme et
   interfrer avec celles dfinies dans common.h ou autre)

 o Dans intf_msg j'ai du remplacer les vasprintf par des vsprintf
   dans le cas o ARCH=BEOS.

 o la commande hostname du Makefile n'tait pas compatible et je
   l'ai donc enlev, en avons-nous besoin ? Auquel cas il suffit de
   rajouter un ifeq.

 o J'ai aussi remplac  les bzero et bcopy par memset et memmove.

 o plugin.c, mtime.c et threads.h et quelques fichiers de l'input
   ont t adapts  BeOS  grand coup de #ifdef SYS_*.

 TODO:

 o Ecrire intf_beos.cpp, vout_beos.cpp et aout_beos.cpp

 Je suis sous linux et je viens de tester le client qui marche trs
 bien, mais il est nanmoins possible que j'ai introduit quelques
 problmes de compilations pour certains modules, si c'est le cas
 prvenez moi.

2000-03-04 Saturday 11:52  sam

  - a compile sous FreeBSD (mais a ne tourne pas)
  - les dpendances sont caches dans .deps/ au lieu de deps/
  - suppression d'encore quelques #include inutiles.
  - la gestion des plugins est maintenant encapsule dans misc/plugin.c
   un peu comme les threads, pour faciliter le portage.
  - lger remaniement de l'output pour --help et --version
  - les p_ts_packet sont casts en (void *) pour viter un warning sous
   certaines architectures.
  - ajout de la GPL dans un fichier COPYING
  - fichier README avec rien dedans pour le moment,  part la liste de
   toutes les personnes ayant particip au projet. J'en ai *forcment*
   oubli certains, alors si vous avez un nom, rajoutez-le. de mme, s'il
   y a un gros con que j'ai mis par erreur dans la liste et qui n'a jamais
   rien fait pour le projet, n'hsitez pas  le supprimer sournoisement.
  - fichier AUTHORS avec la liste des gens ayant boss sur le client. j'ai
   mis toutes les personnes ayant fait au moins un commit, ainsi que Henri
   parce que je sais qu'il bosse sur l'audio, et HPReg, Steve et Oli parce
   qu'ils ont boss dessus aussi. Par contre ici aussi j'ai fort probable-
   ment oubli des gens. Corrigez !
  - rpertoire debian/ qui servira  crer des packages
  - rajout d'une entre pour faire `make install' (pas encore parfait)
  - nom de code de la future release 0.2 : `Onatopp' :)

   . aprs le demoronifier, le GPLifier: il y a les enttes de la GPL dans

    nom dans chaque fichier qui est votre oeuvre ou auquel vous avez

    c'est plus pour des raisons pratiques que pour la gloire.

   . rajout de -lthreads pour que a linke sous Hurd

   . rajout de quelques #include pour que a compile sous FreeBSD

     'Illegal instruction', a venait probablement de l)
  . rajout de quelques commentaires pour expliquer en quoi certains #include
     sont ncessaires, aux endroits o je ne comprenais pas, et suppression
     de #include qui semblaient inutiles.

 Created a small&clean public interface for the ac3 decoder (see ac3_decoder.h)

 Modified ac3_decoder_thread to use this interface

 Find ac3 sync words not by scanning the ac3 stream but by using the magic
 bytes at the start of the ac3 pes packets

2000-02-28 Monday 02:35  walken

 Separation du decodeur ac3 et de la partie specifique a videolan

 Les interfaces du deco ac3 ne sont pas encore bien propres et documentees
 mais ca viendra dans un second temps. Les fichiers ac3 ne dependent plus
 d'includes videolan. C'est deja une bonne premiere etape.

 Au niveau du bitstream compresse, l'interface avec le decodeur ac3 ne se fait
 plus par le fichier decoder_fifo.h. En effet, le decodeur ac3 a besoin de
 connaitre la structure exact d'un bitstream_t, donc cette interface n'etait
 pas la plus propre. La nouvelle interface se compose d'une fonction
 ac3_byte_stream_next (ac3_byte_stream_t * p_byte_stream) que le decodeur
 ac3 appelle lorsqu'il a besoin d'un nouveau buffer de donnees compressees.

 ac3_byte_stream_t est une structure comprenant les champs
 u8 * p_byte (pointeur sur le debut du buffer),
 u8 * p_end (pointeur sur la fin du buffer),
 void * info (utilisation libre pour implementer ac3_byte_stream_next)

 L'implementation actuelle de ac3_byte_stream_next () dans ac3_decoder_thread.c
 fait un peu double emploi avec misc/decoder_fifo.c mais je reglerai tout ca
 plus tard.

 Decoupage de vdec_motion en deux parties :

 vdec_motion_inner contient le code plus ou moins bourin qui calcule les pixels
 (je pense que c'est la que la majorite du temps est ecoulee, et qu'il y aurait
 eventuellement un avantage a rechercher des optimisations particulieres pour
 ce fichier, genre debouclage de boucles ou quelque chose du genre)

 Le code dans vdec_motion contient quand a lui des tests sur le type exact
 de prediction a effectuer, des calculs de pointeurs en fonction des motion
 vectors, et les appels a vdec_motion_inner.

 La fonction MotionComponent de vdec_motion a ete modifiee pour appeler
 directement la bonne fonction de vdec_motion_inner en fonction des parametres.
 La encore en raison de la gestion d'inlines faite a la compilation, pour chaque
 appel les parametres i_width, i_height et b_average sont deja connus et
 donc l'appel de MotionComponent devrait s'etendre a un simple switch (i_select)
 et un appel de la fonction correspondante dans vdec_motion_inner.

 Le code dans vdec_motion presente toujours une apparence contestable mais
 je n'ai pas modifie son fonctionnement (seulement la fonction MotionComponent).

 travail sur l'ac3_decoder : debut de separation de ce qui est specifique a
 videolan (ac3_decoder_thread) et de ce qui ne l'est pas. Ce n'est pas encore
 ideal, la partie "videolan" fait des inits a l'interieur de la partie
 "ac3"... il faudra que je fasse une belle interface pour ca.

 Le probleme des includes n'est pas non plus regle, mais c'est a cause des
 bit_streams :) patience.

 La plupart des causes de segfault de la video ont t limines, les messages
 d'erreur qui sont affichs sur stderr vous donnerons une bonne ide du nombres
 d'occasions de planter qui se prsentent au client.

 J'ai aussi remis le flag DEBUG  1 et commenter omit-frame-pointer pour que
 tout le monde puisse avoir la chance de participer  la chasse aux segfaults
 avec son gdb. Les bugs report sont le bienvenu (surtout si c pour l'audio ;).

2000-02-17 Thursday 19:27  walken

 Modification de decoder_fifo.h : le cas ou on passe d'un buffer a l'autre
 lors de la lecture d'un octet n'est plus inline. Precedemment le code etait
 inclus a chaque invocation de NeedBits ou GetBits...

 Vu l'etat de la synchro je n'ai pas pu mesurer d'impact precis sur les fps
 mais je ne m'attends pas a ce qu'il soit mesurable de toute facon : on troque
 un apel de fonction contre un meilleur comportement du cache code...

 Premier checkin de ma part, mais il devrait en venir d'autres.

 irrgularits du flux peuvent perturber le client de faon non ngligeable.

  o argument supplmentaire pour GetBufInfo() pour que la mthode dummy
   attende un temps convenable, et correction de aout_dummy.c
  o le test sur la variable DEBUG dans config.h est maintenant conforme
    ce que dit le Makefile.
  o suppression d'une variable inutile dans intf_fb.c
  o --long-help devient --longhelp comme dans mpg123
  o version du programme arbitrairement mise  0.95.0
  o commentaire d'une variable inutilise dans Synchronize (video_output.c)
  o correction du "LIN" en "LIB" dans le Makefile, qui doit traner l
   depuis des sicles
  o proprification de quelques routines du Makefile

 le code de slection de mthode audio/video est loin d'tre propre, je
 dirais mme que c'est du gros caca, mais j'y bosse.

  . tentative de correction de la dtection de MMX pour BeOS
  . nouvelle option vlc_vout_method (faute de mieux pour le moment)
  . modification du Makefile pour supporter plusieurs VIDEO_*

 dornavant on peut compiler plusieurs output diffrents dans le
 client. la prfrence se fait dans l'ordre x11, fb, ggi, glide...

 si on le compile avec x11 et fb, par dfaut il se lancera en X.

 Encapsulation des pthread qui sont maintenant remplaces par les vlc_thread.
 Toutes les rfrences aux pthread que ce soit les thread, les mutex ou
 les variables conditionnelles, ont t remplaces par leur quivalent
 vlc_thread. Les vlc_thread sont une version trs simplifie des pthread et
 fonctionnent exactement de la mme faon. Ceci devrait grandement faciliter
 le portage vers d'autres OS.

 Debugage de DemuxPSI. Le nouveau code doit etre capable de gerer des cas
