 * libvlc.h input.c headphone.c:
     fix support of audio channel mixers, like the headphone channel mixer
     for instance, which was broken since the introduction of user audio
     filters; if specified by the user and compatible with the audio
     pipeline, we add the channel mixer after the user filters.
     -> unfortunately, this fix removed two strings and introduced 4 new
        ones
     -> TODO: allow the user to choose only amongst channel mixers, not
        all available audio filters

 * vlc.exe.manifest Makefile.am install-win32 :

 * Commented out the option 'goom' for the visualizer. It isn't working in
   this system yet and will not work before release. The visualizer system
   needs to be cleaned in 0.7.1 with one 'visual' audio filter which loads
   one or more 'visualization' true modules.

 * src/playlist/sort.c: set "intf-change" after sorting the playlist

2003-12-13 Saturday 17:16  gbazin

 * src/playlist/*: when deleting the currently playing item, skip it instead of stopping the playlist.
 * include/modules_inner.h, include/configuration.h: don't use a static array anymore during the initialization of the plugins, malloc it instead. This fixes regular overflow problems we have when we increase the number of options in the main module.

   have been assigned with Ctrl+Fn. But they are, if assigned via the
   preferences panel.

 cddax and vcdx.

 Long device text no longer used.

2003-12-11 Thursday 12:56  rocky

 Switch over to using "cd-audio" and "vcd" configuration variables.

2003-12-11 Thursday 12:52  rocky

 VCD or CD "title" 0 means adds entire contents (or possibly PBC for VCD).

 Set compilation flags so that code (e.g. frontends) can test presence
 or absense of vcdx/cddax.

2003-12-11 Thursday 05:27  rocky

 Improve MRL creation.

 1. MRL's are of the form xxx://
 2. Customize depending on vcdx/vcd or cddax/cdd
 3. cdda doesn't have any such notion of a "Chapter", so remove
    the misleading :x.

 For cddax/vcdx, I'm not sure though I think there is more to do.

 * src/misc/mtime.c: fixed an overflow in mdate() on win32.
   This overflow was only affecting the hardware configurations where we can't use the performance counter and thus have to use GetTickCount().
   We now also check for the wrapping of the 32 bits value returned by GetTickCount() so mdate() doesn't wrap after 49.7 days.
 * src/misc/win32_specific.c: call mdate() once in system_Init() so as to avoid thread safety issues while initialising the static variables used in mdate().

  Also changed the width and height options so that if only one of them is specified, the other one is calculated automatically so as to keep the aspect ratio of the video.
 * modules/mux/ogg.c: fixed crash when removing streams.
 * modules/codec/theora.c: for now the theora encoder requires a width and height which are multiple of 16.

 Removing last files of previous Familiar interface. Porting to Gtk+2 widget set of this interface is now finished. Policing and improving remains.

2003-12-06 Saturday 22:53  jpsaman

 Always use correct datatypes.

2003-12-06 Saturday 22:50  jpsaman

 Fixed compiler waring about signed - unsigned comparision. It is always safer to use the same datatype when comparing values.

2003-12-06 Saturday 22:47  jpsaman

 Updating with info for upcoming Opie interface.

2003-12-06 Saturday 22:45  jpsaman

 Updating AUTHORS list for me.

2003-12-06 Saturday 22:41  jpsaman

 PDA Interface:
 - Fixed last segmentation fault.
 - Slider and time progress updating.

 This makes the new PDA interface almost complete. It misses the following items still:
 - preference panel
 - changing postion in stream with slider widget.

 The missing items above will move to the next release of VLC. Now testing and package building for iPAQ will begin. I expect to have a package at the end of the week.

 Slightly better handling of stills and toggling pause by using the
 different threads better.

 Still has stream still/to MPEG bug and duplicate video window bug though.
 (And could use lots of cleanup.)

2003-12-05 Friday 02:33  rocky

 Remove interface thread. It was a crock anyway -- any good stuff
 should be put into the visualization plugins instead.

 Besides, there are bigger crocks that need fixing (like VCD navigation).

 intf.c, vcdplayer.c: Add code for multi-default selection lists. But
 this required new libvcdinfo API - so change to configure.ac for

 Additional libvcdinfo routines also means less VCD twidling inside vlc

 get more so.

   - kludged so that the module works perfectly well with the demuxstream

 dvbsub.c: DVB subtitles decoder (ETSI EN 300 743). There is still a lot of
           things to write to implement competely the standard but this decoder
           will work in most of the pictures subtitles cases. Text subtitles
           decoding is not implemented at all.
           This decoder has been validated with CAVENA encoders after few
           remarks of their developpers.

 include/*: addded a p_spuinfo field in the decider_fifo_t and the
            es_descriptor_t

 codecs.h: added a dvb_spuinfo_t structure to identify the id of the selected
           track.

 modules/demux/mpeg: added the support of the dvb subtitles track. Need last
                     libdvbpsi (0x59 descriptor) to compile. The demuxer
                     creates n fake ES as each ES carries up to 256 subtitles
                     tracks.

  * adpcm: converted to new API (need more testing).

2003-11-04 Tuesday 11:11  titer

  + configure.ac:
      fixed a link issue on BeOS
  + modules/demux/util/sub.c:
      gcc != 3 fix
  + modules/gui/beos/*:
      compile fixes; never replace int32 with int32_t, these are not the
      same on BeOS (long/int)

2003-11-04 Tuesday 02:23  fenrir

  * input: fixed position-offset, time and time-offset.

  * hotkeys: never _never_ use  demux_Control outside of src/input/ (it's
  completely broken,  there is a lot  more things to do),  all interfaces
  have  to  use  var_Get/Set  (time(-offset),  position(-offset),  state,
  rate(-slower|-faster)...  ).
  Btw,   input_SetStatus,   input_Seek,   input_Tell,   input_ChangeArea,
  input_ToggleES,  will   be  quickly   obsolete  and   removed(at  least
  unavailable for intf), so we should convert remaining interfaces (ie all
  except wx, osx, rc, http, hotkeys).

  * avi: implemented DEMUX_SET_TIME (not yet used).

  I have not kept the compatibility with older faad version (but check is
  still be  done in configure.ac). (I  didn't like it as  old version are
  really buggy).

2003-11-03 Monday 20:22  gbazin

 * modules/access/dshow/*: attempt at supporting DV inputs (completely untested).

2003-11-03 Monday 15:27  hartman

 * modules/gui/macosx/*: Commit of the Visualizations menu item.
 * ALL: bring the project files to XCode.
   10.2 users should revert the change in Makefile.am or they won't be able to
   build VLC on their machine. Editing the project files will probably also not
   be possible for them.

2003-11-03 Monday 14:02  gbazin

 * modules/demux/mpeg/*: added support for ISO/IEC 13818-7 Audio with ADTS transport syntax to the TS demux.

2003-11-03 Monday 03:21  garf

2003-11-02 Sunday 22:15  gbazin

 * modules/demux/util/id3.c, modules/demux/util/id3tag.c: don't use input_Peek() to read an id3 tag as these tags can be bigger than what input_Peek() can read.

2003-11-02 Sunday 21:26  gbazin

 * Makefile.am: include the .css file from the html interface into the win32 package.

2003-11-02 Sunday 19:26  gbazin

2003-11-02 Sunday 06:33  hartman

 * modules/audio_output/input.c: created variables to allow for a autogenerated
   Visualizations menu (is this the right location?)
   Problems currently are: Doesn't work on the fly. where to start?
   For that reason it now also uses config options instead of variables.
 * modules/visualization/visual/visual.c: small adaptions
 * modules/gui/macosx/controls.m: fix warnings.

2003-11-02 Sunday 01:41  hartman

 * Fixed bugs in parsing SSA lines. Turns out we are currently parsing within demuxers.
   The parsing of lines should of course be moved to the decoder level.

2003-11-01 Saturday 21:50  fenrir

  * added stream_out_rtp.

2003-11-01 Saturday 14:35  hartman

 * an ebuild that pulls vlc from cvs and installs that.

2003-11-01 Saturday 10:07  sam

   * debian/control:
     + Build-depend on a newer wxwindows version to avoid incompatibilities.
     + Build-depend on linux-kernel-headers and build-conflict on dvb-dev
       because these packages cannot be installed together.
   * debian/rules:
     + Temporarily disabled the framebuffer video output plugin because of
        current code errors in linux-kernel-headers.

2003-11-01 Saturday 06:57  fenrir

  * rtp: added l8 (u8 samples) and l16 (s16b samples) support (eg to use with
  transcode).

2003-11-01 Saturday 06:56  fenrir

  * araw: mhh, aout_buffer_t.i_nb_samples is samples _per_ channels...

2003-11-01 Saturday 06:27  fenrir

  * araw: added pseudo raw encoder. (s16b and s16l -> u8,s8, s16l,s16b).

2003-11-01 Saturday 04:17  fenrir

  * rtp: - added TS/PS support. (ex: #rtp{dst=ip,port=port,mux=ts} )
        PS will work if there is only one stream as the muxer doesn't set
        correctly dts/length for muxed packets. (so pretty useless ;)
         - added mpeg1/2 video. (how overcomplicated is rfc2250),
        tested with mplayer+live.com (but I'm not sure that my ES parsing
        is ok.)
         - btw, there is a ttl option.

2003-11-01 Saturday 00:15  fenrir

  * rtp: Added mpeg4 video(rfc 3016) and audio(mpeg4-generic). ( but far
        from perfect)
         Use udp raw mode.
         Generate a SDP file (for now it is just fprintf to stderr).
         The streams produced work under gmp4player. (mpeg4ip)

2003-11-01 Saturday 00:11  fenrir

  * udp: added a new option: raw, to use it udp{raw} (It doesn't try to
 fill packet send to mtu size, needed by rtp)

2003-10-31 Friday 23:57  sam

   * The "coincoin" Debian upload (no, it's not a cocker).

2003-10-31 Friday 22:46  hartman

 * starting support for external vobsubs.
   we can now read the .idx file. TODO:
   - create a structure to store subinfo in (like WAVEFORMATEX and BITMAPINFO
   - allow for multiple tracks in the sub demux
   - open the .sub vobsub file, remove the mpeg crud and prepare a packet
     for spudec.

2003-10-31 Friday 18:18  gbazin

 * modules/control/hotkeys.c: use demux_Control( p_input, DEMUX_SET_TIME, ...) to seek, for better precision.
 * modules/video_output/directx/events.c: fix to catch the Alt key.

2003-10-31 Friday 16:57  fenrir

  * begin to add a rtp mixer. For now it support mpeg audio and ac3(untested).
  TODO: (a lot of work)
     - gather multiple small frames in one packets (not really important).
     - add mpeg 1/2 video
     - export a sdp file (needed for all next codecs).
     - add mpeg4 audio/video
     - add ts/ps over RTP.
     - perhaps ogg over RTP if something is abled to read that.

  command: #rtp{dst=ip,port=port,[mux=muxer]} (mux not yet implemented)

  It automaticaly uses ip:port, ip:port+2, ip:port+4 ... (port should
  be odd btw)

2003-10-31 Friday 15:54  hartman

2003-10-30 Thursday 22:34  hartman

 * implemented a vout_OSDMessage to display messages on the video at a specific
   location by any module.
 * added a OSD config option to the Video options. this will allow you to disable
   the messages printed by OSDMessage. Subtitles will still be shown however.
 * src/audio_output/intf.c: volumeSet sets the intf-change variable.
 * modules/gui/macosx/vout.m: fix the modifier detection.

2003-10-30 Thursday 21:44  gbazin

 Grmbl, it was obvious I would forget to add the new files

2003-10-29 Wednesday 17:32  zorglub

 * src/playlist/* && Makefile.am
    - splitted the enormous playlist.c file
    - implemented a better item group system: groups have a name
      and must be created before use by
       playlist_CreateGroup( p_playlist, "newgroupname")

 * modules/misc/sap.c
    - Create our own playlist group ("SAP") and use it

 * modules/access/slp.c
    - Create our own playlist group ("SLP") and use it

 * modules/demux/util/id3tag.c
    - Trigger playlist update when we have parsed our tag

    - Added the Sort menu with several criteria (title, author, group)
    - Added up/down buttons to move an item in the playlist
    - Added the group menu to enable/disable a group in an understandable way

 TODO:
 -----

 * playlist core :
    - Implement advanced sort capabilities  (multi-criteria)
    - File format to save the new features
    - export playlist (to M3U, eg)
    - more robust group creation (duplicates check, ...)

 * wxWindows playlist:
    The idea of a treeview seems impossible, because of wxWindow's treeview,
    that don't allow multi-selection, and, as far as I know, multi-columns.
    - Provide a frontend to advanced sort (when it's done :-) )
    - Allow moving items by drag & drop (well, if possible, haven't checked yet)
    - Allow moving several items at once
    - Customizable listview (ability to remove/move columns)
    - Find a solution to the focus problem
      (when you change track, the selected one scrolls at the
       bottom of the visible screen)

 * wxWindows interface:
    - New icons, our icons begin to get old and not so pretty
    - Find a solution for the volume bar (nobody understands what it is)

2003-10-29 Wednesday 12:23  gbazin

 Don't assume when Activate is called that i_tell is at the beginning of

  configure.ac:
   + updated libebml/libmatroska detection as matroska headers no longer

  modules/control/http.c:
   + fix for gcc != 3

2003-10-20 Monday 22:43  fenrir

  Btw, the first who ask me to write another documentation will just go
  to hell ;)

2003-10-20 Monday 22:28  gbazin

2003-10-20 Monday 15:28  zorglub

 Removed an awful debug message

2003-10-20 Monday 12:25  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/preferences*: added GetName(), GetType() and IsAdvanced() to ConfigControl and got rid of ConfigData for even more simplifications.

2003-10-20 Monday 10:37  gbazin

 * Makefile.am, bootstrap, mozilla/Makefile.am: don't try to build pic _and_ non-pic code on win32 as there's no need for pic code on this platform. This should almost reduce the compilation time by a factor of 2 when the mozilla plugin is activated in the build process.

2003-10-20 Monday 01:07  hartman

 * even less duplicate entries by id3tags. Dupes are annoying :)

2003-10-20 Monday 00:09  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/preferences*: beware, casts from strings to char * are allocated on the stack.

2003-10-20 Monday 00:01  hartman

   - better use of name and uri fields of playlist_item_t
   - when users d&d a CD on VLC, it will now play. This breaks d&d folders
     located on a CD for now. Not really important but should be fixed later on.

2003-10-19 Sunday 22:52  sigmunau

 modules/gui/wxwindows/interface.cpp: oooops

2003-10-19 Sunday 22:41  sigmunau

 Factored the code for each of the different types of config options out into
 separate widgets. This makes preferences.cpp much cleaner and opens up
 greater possibilities for the config item controls.
 * Added "browse..." button to CONFIG_ITEM_DIRECTORY
 * Added a slider to CONFIG_ITEM_INTEGER when i_min or i_max differs from 0
 * Made it possible to change CONFIG_ITEM_KEY options with the preferences
 dialog

   - release your objects when you finished using them.

2003-10-19 Sunday 12:37  gbazin

2003-10-18 Saturday 21:46  hartman

 * The SAMI parses did case sensitive tag parsing. However both START, Start
   and start are legal tags. I added a local_stristr (also sometime known as strcasestr)
   function to this file. It probably doesn't belong here, anyone is welcome
   to move it.

2003-10-18 Saturday 20:09  gbazin

2003-10-17 Friday 18:38  gbazin

2003-10-17 Friday 18:17  ipkiss

  * modules/gui/skins/*:
         Added an "Always on top" entry in the system menu (it can also
         be triggered by Ctrl+T). Implemented on Windows only, but to do

2003-10-14 Tuesday 23:09  gbazin

2003-10-14 Tuesday 22:41  gbazin

 * Updated the subtitle info in the README file.

2003-10-12 Sunday 21:53  hartman

 * added a "auto" mode to sub-type. This is because the wxwin intf doesn't
   like dropdown lists, with no selection. it therefore selects the first item
   in this case microdvd, which then has the potential that you can save and
   set this sub-type accidently.

2003-10-12 Sunday 09:49  gbazin

 * src/video_output/video_text.h: removed useless file.

2003-10-11 Saturday 22:40  hartman

   same track_id and therefore were all (un)selected at the same time.

 New spanish translation, by Antonio Javier Varela.

 P.S. : it compiles fine, but I can't figure out how to change the

2003-10-09 Thursday 19:40  gbazin

 * modules/gui/macosx/output.m: updated part of the Stream output dialog
 * modules/demux/util/sub.c: removed sub_detect() and moved the sub-file and

 * src/libvlc.h: description strings etc for sub-file and sub-autodetect-file
 * src/input/subtitles.c: new subtitles_Detect() largely based on the
   code used by MPlayer. Adapted for coding style and structure differences.

 The autodetect routine can now detect multiple subtitle files and assigns scores
 based on their names. if they much well enough they are sorted based on their
 score. It will then return this set, and they will all be added as SPU tracks
 to the current stream. The (un)selecting of these tracks will need to be fixed
 because they all get assigned the es id 0xFF currently.

 * ALL: Introduction of a new api for decoders.
    The final aim of this new api is to make it possible to use the decoders from other modules like the transcoder for instance.
    Only a few decoders have been ported to the new api (a52, libmpeg2, dts, vorbis, theora) so the old api is still supported.

    Don't hold your breath, there is still much work to do before we reach this goal.

 * added a vlc_current_charset function. This tries to get the current charset
   in use by the OS. It's pretty nifty. if available it uses nl_langinfo. Then
   it falls back to trying setlocale (exept on OSX, where this funtion is useless)
   and then falls back to LC_ALL, LC_TYPE and LANG environment variables.
   If only the LANG variable is available (like on osx) it tries a countrycode
   to charset mapping (making an educated guess ).
   On windows it retrieves the charset with GetACP().
   It also has an aliases system to transform incompatible charset description
   strings to libiconv compatible charset descriptions. If you want you can even
   retrieve the charset on OS/2.
 * modules/codec/subsdec/subsdec.c: By default we try to open a subtitle file in
   the systems charset (or language mapped to charset). It's no more than a guess,

   specify the encoding by hand, but it's better then nothing.

  ts: large rewrite of the TS muxer to produce better TS and support DVD
      subtitle.
      I have added some options:
         - bmin : minimum bitrate (bits/s) of the TS. Padding is added in
         case of insuffisant bitrate. (default: disabled).
         - bmax : maximum bitrate (bit/s) of the TS. It just drops packets
         to achieve the target. (default: disabled)
         - pcr : minimum delay between two pcr equal to dts of the video
         stream (default 100ms)
         - pcr-soft : minimum delay between two pcr interpolated from the
         pcr that are equal to dts. (default: none)
  Remarks:
   - bmin/bmax allow to create CBR stream.
   - Bitrate is calculated on a PCR time.
   - PCR delay cannot be less than length of a frame of the PCR stream.
   - PCR soft is used to help when using big PCR delay. It is usefull to
   produce stream with smoother bitrate variation.
   - Big PCR delay introduce more latency.

 Interface for Familiar v0.7 and GPE. This interface is based on gtk2 libaries.

2003-07-23 Wednesday 22:01  gbazin

 * include/variables.h, src/misc/variables.c: you can now use var_Create() directly to create an object variable with an inherited value.
    eg. var_Create( p_vout, "zoom", VLC_VAR_FLOAT | VLC_VAR_DOINHERIT );
    Beware, the object in which you create the var must be attached to a parent for this to work (otherwise we can't navigate the parents hierarchy to find the value to inherit).

 * src/input/input.c, src/input/input_programs.c, src/video_output/video_output.c: converted more config_GetFoo() into var_Create()/var_Get();

2003-07-23 Wednesday 21:45  hartman

 When recv() returns -1 a bug is triggered inside RTPRead() and RTPChoose(). The return value of Read() is then -1. The test "if (!i_ret) return 0;" will be false and the function will continue resulting in segfault while copying from buffers that are in an undetermined state. The correct test is "if (i_ret<0) return 0;".

2003-07-23 Wednesday 01:13  gbazin

 * ALL: changes to the playlist_Add() and VLC_AddTarget() proto to include a list of options associated with the input.
 * src/input/input.c: parses the input options list before spawning the input and create object variables for these options. Options are of the form "[no[-]]foo[=bar]" where foo is the option name and bar is its value.
 * src/input/input.c, src/input/input_dec.c: use the object var api to get the value of the "sout", "sout-video" and "sout-audio" options.
 * src/libvlc.c: extended the command line parser to parse input options. Input options must always follow the input they apply to and begin with a ':'.

 All these changes allow you to specify input specific options.
 eg: ./vlc --no-sout-audio yourvideo.mpeg :sout=udp/http::8080 :sout-audio yourvideo2.mpeg
 Here the ":sout" option will only apply to yourvideo.mpeg.
 "--no-sout-audio" will be a global option so will apply to yourvideo2.mpeg but the global behaviour is overriden by ":sout-audio" for yourvideo.mpeg.

 TODO: - the interfaces need to be modified to benefit from the new playlist_Add() api.
       - only "sout", "sout-video", "sout-audio" implemented for now. To make it work with other options, we need to get rid of all the config_GetFoo() and replace them with var_Create()/var_Change()/var_Get().

 I think I did this correctly, but it might be wise to review this :)

2003-07-18 Friday 20:52  gbazin

 * src/libvlc.h: disabled the encoders config options (encoders are not used anymore, all the encoding is done in the stream output transcode module).
 * src/misc/win32_specific.c: added an --high-priority config option on win32 to increase the priority of the process (default enabled for now so the behaviour isn't changed.)

    Dialog providers expose an api that allow other modules to use the GUI dialogs the module provides (open dialogs, etc...).
    + misc small enhancements.

 * modules/gui/skins/*: completely removed the dependancy on the wxwindows code (which also eliminates the need for the basic_skins module).
    The skins module will now try to load a "dialogs provider" to display the open, messages, file info and preferences dialogs.

   * modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: Select events in the video subwindow
     instead of the base window, because newer versions of Mozilla select
     ButtonPress for the window it gives us, and XSelectInput only allows
     one client to select this event.

 All: My shot at improving subtitle rendering in vlc. Now each vout uses a "text renderer" module to render text on the video when needed. I decieded to make this a module type, because other api's (win32 and macosx) is supposed to do better than freetype under some circumstances.

 include/video_output.h: added some members needed by text renderer modules
 src/video_output/video_output.c: load and unload text renderer module when needed
 src/video_output/video_text.c: implemented some functions to show text on the video
 include/osd.h: exported the functions to show text
 modules/misc/Modules.am, module/misc/freetype.c: new text renderer module, largly based on the old osdtext module.
 modules/video_filter/Modules.am, modules/video_filter/osd_text.c: removed the osdtext module
 configure.ac: changes "osdtext" to "freetype" some places
 modules/codec/spudec/*: when iconv is available, use it to convert textual subtitles from the encoding given by --sub-encoding to utf8. Use new code to render subtitles
 modules/control/lirc/lirc.c: use new code to give feedback on buttons pressed. untested.
 modules/demux/util/sub.c: remove all traces of the ugly old osdtext module
 modules/misc/dummy/*: added a "text renderer" submodule in the dummy module
 src/misc/modules.c: included osd.h as it seems to be needed to export symbols

 final notes: you need to give a proper value to --freetype-font. This should be the path to a font file freetype2 can handle (almost any format afaik) with a unicode translation table in it. Windows ttf files will do. In linux at least openoffice distributes some fonts that work. I think macosx and beos also has useable fonts.

2003-07-14 Monday 20:36  sigmunau

 toolbox: made a --add-include that can be used by doxygen to get proper
          includes in the .h files, since they are parsed out of context by
 	 doxygen
 Doxyfile: misc fixes, use ./toolbox --add-include as filter for sources.
 include/vlc_common.h: doxygenized VLC_COMMON_MEMBERS

 With these changes, and a slightly patched version of doxygen (which you can
 get here: http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~sigmunau/doxygen-vlcpatched.tgz ) you should
 be able to get some useful documentation out of the vlc sources.

2003-07-14 Monday 16:10  gbazin

 * modules/demux/mpeg: 0x06 stream type can be used for something else
   than A/52, so disabled it for the moment (we should actually check for
   the presence of a descriptor).

2003-07-13 Sunday 12:15  massiot

 * modules/codec/libmpeg2.c: Fixed a major bug where the picture heap
   would progressively empty on some DVDs.

2003-07-12 Saturday 13:33  gbazin

 * modules/audio_output/directx.c: 5.1 audio output now works on sblive/audigy as well :)
 * modules/audio_output/waveout.c: fixed the waveOut plugin so works on NT4 as well... that complicates the plugin a bit more than I would have wanted, but hey.
 * modules/gui/wxwindows/messages.cpp: the verbose checkbox is set to the value of the --verbose config option.

 * configure.ac: always use the built-in getop on win32 (cygwin's one is buggy).
     Disable the gtk2/gnome2 interfaces as they are currently unuseable and this option was confusing users more than anything else.
     Enabled the mp4 muxer (Although it doesn't yet produce streams compatible with quicktime).

  There is no more hardcoded html page. The interface recursively parse a
 directory, exporting all  files. All .htm/.html are  parsed, and special
 macro are  used. I will commit  somes samples pages in  share/http and I
 hope documentations.

  TODO: - (re)implement access control in httpd (but in a useable way).
        - clean login/password management. (for now .access protects
        a whole directory).
        - doc ;)

     + New build system, using recursive makefiles. Due to the amount of code

 * configure.ac.in : fixed linking of skins modules
 * modules/gui/skins/*:
   - fixed the wxwindows bug, due to a huge bug with broadcast events
   - beginning of fonts in X11 skins
 so, you can test the X11 skins module: it should work now !

  * skins/controls/button.cpp: Fixed a nasty bug.
  * skins/controls/generic.h: Some public fields are now protected
  * skins/src/window.cpp:
     - Added a few debug messages
     - Invisible controls don't receive events anymore

 Note: There are still a few bugs in the code handling the controls and
 their different states, and I think they will be difficult to fix with
 the current code structure. A rewrite of this part of code could be a
 good idea (perhaps using states and transitions between states, like
 Zinf does?).

  muxer but this will break compatibility).

  * src/input/input_ext-intf.c :  added an input_SetRate function; it is
    quite more convenient than, e.g, calling input_SetStatus( STATUS_FASTER )
    two times if you want to switch from 1:1 to 4:1 from the interface.
    Old functions still work.
  * modules/gui/beos/VlcWrapper.cpp : use it

  * mjpeg grabbing added, thanks to Paul Forgey <paulf at aphrodite dot com>
  that had done all the work.

 Paul Forgey's notes:
 --------------------

 Unfortunatley, the v4l interface shows how much it sucks here.  I can't
 wait for v4l2 to become more common.  Anyway, the mjpeg mechanism
 captures completely differently than the uncompressed frame capture
 mechanism.  This means the code has to split off a bunch to do similar
 things depending on mjpeg being set or not.  For some reason, I can't
 use non v4l2 calls to capture uncompressed frames from the lml33,
 however I do have another bttv card on my system to test that I didn't
 break the non-mjpeg stuff.

 The Zoran encoders don't use square pixels.  So the 4:3 (or 16:9)
 picture is going to show up as 720x480.  I don't know my way around the
 code well enough to know how to specify a non-square pixel aspect
 ratio.  If there isn't a way to do it, it would be nice to be able to
 specify as an option the aspect ratio of the sourc.  Either 4:3 or 16:9
 in the case of anamorphic S-Video, which does occur.

 I stole the videodev_mjpeg.h header from the lavrec project.  Despite
 the linux kernels having support for the Zoran cards, there doesn't seem
 to be a reliable way to pick up this header, which is probably why
 lavrec did it this way.  Since it only defines ioctl definitions, I
 don't think using it is a legal problem.

 I also modified the audio handling a bit.  If the card supports audio,
 great, we'll set the card's parameters as we did before.  But if adev=
 is specified, use it regardless.  The reason to do this is to capture
 audio from the sound card with video coming from, say, a web cam or in
 my case, an encoder card which doesn't have any audio capabilities at
 all.

   check, i'm not entirely sure this is correct. Actually i think we should
   split this up in more then one config item, for GUI preferences clarity.
   Something like crop-width, crop-height, crop-h-offset, crop-v-offset, or
   like ffmpeg has which uses left, right, top and bottom offsets.

 * First set config variable, then add the files (and therefore potentially

2003-05-11 Sunday 01:00  massiot

 * modules/audio_filter/resampler/coreaudio.c: more accurate frame length
   calculation
 * modules/audio_output/coreaudio.c: apparently the audio card clock can
   be screwed, so probe it at every buffer
 * src/audio_output/output.c: Thou shalt not drop buffers

2003-05-10 Saturday 20:49  hartman

 * fix titer's language commit. The list needs to end with a NULL, or VLC will

  POTFILES.in: forgot a file yesterday...

2003-05-10 Saturday 11:05  hartman

    Interface" to the popup

2003-05-08 Thursday 01:16  hartman

 ALL: autogenerated menu's for chapter,title,program,audio-es,spu-es and video-es.
   - video-es seems broken. it always starts with -1 (Disabled) selected.
   - moved some menuitems to other menu's for gui interface consistency with
     other gui's.
   - added a "fit to screen" menuitem.

2003-05-08 Thursday 01:05  titer

  src/misc/beos_specific.cpp:
      Fixed a very old bug: if the user hit Alt+Q, don't let the be_app

2003-05-07 Wednesday 15:54  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: Fix (use different id numbers for each menus).

2003-05-07 Wednesday 15:44  fenrir

  * ffmpeg: --ffmpeg-truncated is now an int :
   * -1 -> CODEC_FLAG_TRUNCATED is set only if width == height == 0 (only TS should produce this)
   * 0  -> disable CODEC_FLAG_TRUNCATED
   * 1  -> force CODEC_FLAG_TRUNCATED

2003-05-07 Wednesday 14:49  titer

  modules/gui/beos/*: fixed a few things I broke recently (dvd menus,

 any misdetection. (Even when there is a spec, nobody follows it :((

2003-05-07 Wednesday 00:28  fenrir

   the VLCWindow could suddenly disappear (the vout closed) and therefore we

   more generic to avoid code duplication.

2003-05-06 Tuesday 16:05  fenrir

  * mp4: fix a segfault and play .3gp with h263 video track.

2003-05-05 Monday 22:23  gbazin

    - added a VLC_VAR_SETTEXT and VLC_VAR_GETTEXT method to var_Change()
      that are used to set/get a friendly name to an object variable.
    - added VLC_VAR_CHOICESCOUNT to var_Change() to be able to retrieve
      the number of availabel choices without having to get their value
      as well.
    - VLC_VAR_ADDCHOICE uses the extra var_Change() argument to assign
      a friendly name to the choice value.
    - VLC_VAR_GETCHOICES retrieves the choices values and their friendly
      names.

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: first step in implementing menu auto-generation in the wxWindows interface.

2003-05-04 Sunday 22:33  massiot

  * transcode: follow the same logic for ab than vb. (ie for a small value
 it's used as kb/s for higher ones it's b/s).
 Just a remember, transcode options are:
 acodec= mpga,a52
     ab (kb/s)
 vcodec= mpgv,mp4v,h263,DIV1,DIV2,DIV3,I420,I422,I444,RV24,YUY2
     width
     height
     vb (kb/s)
     vt (b/s)
     deinterlace
     croptop
     cropbottom
     cropleft
     cropright
     keyint
     hq
     qmin (between 1 and 32)
     qmax (between 1 and 32)
 only acodec and/or vcodec are mandatories (and it's a good idea to always
 define vb,vt, and/or ab)

2003-05-04 Sunday 15:02  massiot

 * modules/audio_output/coreaudio.c: worked around a CoreAudio bug (should
   fix the "sound drops after half an hour" bug)

  * all: new sout scheme. Now a chain of module are created that can
 modify/apply on all streams, --sout has the same behavour expect when
 starting with a '#'.

  With a starting '#' you can specify a chain of modules, it's still
 unstable but a lot more powerfull.
  You have access to duplicate(that duplicate all stream), transcode
 (using only ffmpeg), standard/std and es (that apply muxers and access),
 and display. You could chain them with ':' and specify options with
 {option1=value,option2=value[,...]}.

 ex: * to stream and see the stream to udp/ts:ip
  --sout '#duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,url=ip}}'
     * to transcode,see and stream
  --sout '#transcode{acodec=mpga}:duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,url=ip}}'

  Without a starting '#', the url is converted into '#std{acces=,mux=,url}'
 Test and report bugs :)

 * src/misc/modules.c: module_Need() now only raises the scores of the
    plugins matching the given shortcuts list, unless "none" is closing the
    list (in which case only the plugins matching the list can be selected).

    Which means that users will stop complaining vlc doesn't launch anymore
    or can't play anything after they have fiddled with their config
    options :))

 * ALL: got rid of the p_input->b_connected flag.
 * src/input/input_ext-plugins.c, src/input/input.c: fixed the infinite loop
    of "decoder stuck" messages that sometimes happened.

2003-03-24 Monday 00:12  hartman

 * a new directory access module. It parses a directory with dirent and builds
   a m3u 'file' which it feeds to the m3u demuxer.
   Problems: - it requires a dir to end with /
             - if i enabled it, all files would use the m3u demuxer for some
             strange reason. i've spent a day hunting this down, reboot-
             strapping and doing who knows what. I'm sick of it now.
             Someone else can give it a try, if he wants to.

2003-03-18 Tuesday 22:14  hartman

   Now a complete redesign of the hiding of the mousecursor.
   - We use higher level functions now (NSCursor).
   - We only hide if the cursor is over our VLCView
   - In many exceptions we unhide. This is mainly for multimonitor support.

2003-03-18 Tuesday 21:34  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, m4/*, po/Makefile.in.in: build updated to use gettext 0.11.5 by default.

 * modules/gui/macosx/vout.m:
   Reworked the mouse hiding routine. we were always hiding the mousecursor
   on kCGDirectMainDisplay, but this display is always the one with the
   menubar and not always the one containing our VLCVout.
   This new code takes the vout, and calculates on which displays (plural
   because of possible mirroring) it is being shown. It then shows or hides
   the cursor on all of those displays.
   This should fix #396.

   * ./modules/misc/qte_main.cpp, ./modules/misc/gtk_main.c: these plugins now

   - this is 3ivx D4 video
   - it is mpeg 4 compliant and ffmpeg decodes it, via MPEG4.

 * added fourcc '3ivd' to .avi, .mov and ffmpeg.
   - this is video which was divx doctored by the 3ivx doctor program.
   - it is normal DIV3 video and ffmpeg decodes it via MPEG4 v3.

 * added fourcc '3vid' to .avi, .mov and ffmpeg.
   - this is incorrect encoded DIV3. it is an endianness issue by the encoder.
   - ffmpeg can decode it however, so it is mapped to MPEG4 v3.

 * src/audio_output/dec.c, include/aout_internal.h: the aout core was
 automatically discarding audio samples that were above AOUT_MAX_ADVANCE_TIME

 now fetch this value from the input thread when we create an aout_instance_t.
 This solves problems with the http access plugin.

 * modules/audio_filter/converter/mpgatofixed32.c:

    a dos command box.

    backspace key.

2003-02-20 Thursday 01:52  sigmunau

 * include/configuration.h: added a new flag to the configuration stucture to
 indicate wether it is an "advanced" option or not. The goal with this is to
 hide the user from all the strange options that very seldom needs to be
 changed. added an extra argument to all the add_* macros to indicate wether
 the item is advanced or not.
 * src/libvlc.h: added an "show advanced options" config option default
 disabled
 * src/libvlc.c: the advanced options are not listed by vlc --help and
 friends unless --advanced is used
 * modules/gtk/preferences.c: the gtk/gnome preferences dialog don't show
 advanced options unless advanced is set
 all: set the advanced flag to VLC_FALSE or VLC_TRUE for all options, by
 using some common sense. Please check and correct

 note: All interfaces should still work like they used to, see the change in
 modules/gtk/preferences.c to find out how to "hide" options.

 second note: I think I've changed all the modules, but I could not test
 everyone for compilation, expect some broken modules (the fix is to add ",
 VLC_TRUE" as last argument to the add_* I forgot)

 modules/gui/beos/PreferenceWindow.h/.cpp

 	- added revert functionality

 	- changed class design for cleaner functionality,
 		separated ApplyChanges() into more functions

 	- added more error checking and fixed memory leaks
 		(config_GetPsz() returns char*, not const char*!)

 	- all settings are now correctly saved and restored

 	- some more cosmetic changes

 modules/gui/beos/InterfaceWindow.h/.cpp

 	- updated vlc way of saving settings to be on par with BeOS way
 		and made it selectable in the code which way is used.
 		However, the VideoSettings are still only savable in
 		the BeOS way.

 	- if dvd menus are used, the navigation menu enables a
 		"Goto Menu" item. Unfortunately, I don't see a clean
 		way to really detect the usage of dvd/dvdold in the
 		currently playing stream. I wouldn't want to see
 		if a playlist item has "dvd:" or "dvdold:" prepended
 		at each interface update.

 * modules/gui/macosx/*: greatly simplified volume functions ; you can now
   call aout_Volume* even when there is no audio output, and the volume
   will be saved for later use.

 * modules/codec/spudec/spudec.c, modules/codec/spudec/text.c: fixed the

    solution I've been able to come-up with.
    Oh and I didn't fix the memory leak caused by the font when using text
    subtitles. If the vout changes while the spudec is running then we don't
    unload this font.

2003-01-08 Wednesday 10:46  fenrir

 (multiple moov headers is strictly forbidden but I 've seen such file)

2003-01-08 Wednesday 10:43  fenrir

  * faad: fixed a segfault when faad initialisation failed.(anyway it
 doesn't solve the real problem).

2003-01-08 Wednesday 10:41  fenrir

  * ffmpeg/video.c: in case of mpeg4 stream search in p_bitmapinfo for
 an vol header. (In fact reverse an prevous commit)

2003-01-08 Wednesday 10:40  fenrir

2003-01-08 Wednesday 10:38  fenrir

  * pes.c, ps.c: a52 stream should now work.
  * ts.c: added support for libdvbpsi (like ts demux, two modules are
 generated : mux_ts and mux_ts_dvbpsi), fix crc generation for pat/pmt
 without libdvbpsi. More works to add mpeg4 support (now I generate IOD
 and SL descriptor).

2003-01-08 Wednesday 10:26  fenrir

  * all: I have added two new variables in es_descriptor_t and
 decoder_fifo_t (p_waveformatex and p_bitmapinfoheader). It's
 a replacement of p_demux_data as this variable is used by
 some demuxers in another way. This way, I will be able to add
 preliminary support of mpeg4 in mpeg2TS... (I haven't tested ogm
 demuxer so if somebody wants ...)

2003-01-07 Tuesday 15:12  jobi

2003-01-05 Sunday 13:39  gbazin
