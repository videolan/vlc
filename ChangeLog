2003-07-27 Sunday 21:35  jpsaman

 Gtk2 port of the familiar Linux interface. The name is also changed to PDA so it reflects that it is targeted at handhelds.

 The familiar interface itself is deprecreated and will be removed after the next stable version of VLC Media Player.

2003-07-27 Sunday 16:20  gbazin

 - there should be fewer resampling, particularly on DVD chapter changes
 - when you unpause a DVD, VLC will wait for the drive to spin up, so you
 won't lose several seconds of movies

 * modules/gui/macosx/controls.m: Seeking in paused mode resumes the play
 mode, make the interface take that into account.

2003-07-27 Sunday 12:31  ipkiss

     + Removed my name from this file, I didn't contribute anything major to it.

       information, hopefully more useful than "cannot open".

2003-07-24 Thursday 21:50  gbazin

2003-07-24 Thursday 19:30  sigmunau

 ignore CR characters wherever they might be.
 A little better line spaceing, but I still don't understand what this is all
 about.

2003-07-24 Thursday 19:07  sigmunau

 fixed a nasty code duplication where the same function call was two places
 with just a few lines in between, but in separate #if cases.

2003-07-24 Thursday 18:30  bigben

 * "frequency=" is channel frequency in kHz again

 * fix  a segfault when "/dev/video0"  or "norm=" were last  arguments of

2003-07-24 Thursday 17:31  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/open.cpp: compilation fix.

2003-07-24 Thursday 16:07  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: added support for input options in the open dialog.

2003-07-23 Wednesday 23:05  gbazin

 * modules/misc/freetype.c, modules/demux/util/sub.c: cleanup.
 * modules/demux/util/sub.h: thou shall do a vlc_object_attach().

2003-07-23 Wednesday 22:02  jpsaman

 Interface for Familiar v0.7 and GPE. This interface is based on gtk2 libaries.

2003-07-23 Wednesday 22:01  gbazin

 * include/variables.h, src/misc/variables.c: you can now use var_Create() directly to create an object variable with an inherited value.
    eg. var_Create( p_vout, "zoom", VLC_VAR_FLOAT | VLC_VAR_DOINHERIT );
    Beware, the object in which you create the var must be attached to a parent for this to work (otherwise we can't navigate the parents hierarchy to find the value to inherit).

 * src/input/input.c, src/input/input_programs.c, src/video_output/video_output.c: converted more config_GetFoo() into var_Create()/var_Get();

2003-07-23 Wednesday 21:45  hartman

 * include/vlc_common.h: MAX_PATH PATH_MAX, we don't wanna bother and use the
   latter everywhere.
 * modules/demux/util/sub.c: Bring the config options in here to the variable structure.
 * modules/misc/freetype.c: Bring the config options in here to the variable structure.
   Fix the linespacing. Dnumgis, it works, just define another linespacing :)

  freetype.c : use the default BeOS font on BeOS

2003-07-23 Wednesday 17:31  ipkiss

 * all: fixed depcomp failure

2003-07-23 Wednesday 07:37  jpsaman

 When recv() returns -1 a bug is triggered inside RTPRead() and RTPChoose(). The return value of Read() is then -1. The test "if (!i_ret) return 0;" will be false and the function will continue resulting in segfault while copying from buffers that are in an undetermined state. The correct test is "if (i_ret<0) return 0;".

2003-07-23 Wednesday 01:28  gbazin

 * modules/misc/sap.c: oops, compilation fix.

2003-07-23 Wednesday 01:13  gbazin

 * ALL: changes to the playlist_Add() and VLC_AddTarget() proto to include a list of options associated with the input.
 * src/input/input.c: parses the input options list before spawning the input and create object variables for these options. Options are of the form "[no[-]]foo[=bar]" where foo is the option name and bar is its value.
 * src/input/input.c, src/input/input_dec.c: use the object var api to get the value of the "sout", "sout-video" and "sout-audio" options.
 * src/libvlc.c: extended the command line parser to parse input options. Input options must always follow the input they apply to and begin with a ':'.

 All these changes allow you to specify input specific options.
 eg: ./vlc --no-sout-audio yourvideo.mpeg :sout=udp/http::8080 :sout-audio yourvideo2.mpeg
 Here the ":sout" option will only apply to yourvideo.mpeg.
 "--no-sout-audio" will be a global option so will apply to yourvideo2.mpeg but the global behaviour is overriden by ":sout-audio" for yourvideo.mpeg.

 TODO: - the interfaces need to be modified to benefit from the new playlist_Add() api.
       - only "sout", "sout-video", "sout-audio" implemented for now. To make it work with other options, we need to get rid of all the config_GetFoo() and replace them with var_Create()/var_Change()/var_Get().

2003-07-22 Tuesday 22:02  hartman

 * Fix Makefiles for removed .rle fonts

2003-07-22 Tuesday 20:49  hartman

 frequency is  nom frequency  in MHz * 16, as  for the  v4l input.
 Breaks compatibility with previous syntax...

2003-07-22 Tuesday 18:06  gbazin

 * src/stream_output/stream_output.c: fixed segfault when muxer can't add an elementary stream.

2003-07-22 Tuesday 15:59  gbazin

 * src/misc/variables.c: fixed small mem leak (courtesy of Andy Lindsay)
 * modules/gui/wxwindows/interface.cpp: small improvements to the volume control.

2003-07-22 Tuesday 13:58  bigben

 * We're finally parsing all parameters (including standard)
 * syntax is now (roughly) the same as for the v4l input
 ex : vlc pvr:/dev/video0:frequency=1242:norm=secam:size=12x42:bitrate=1200,maxbitrate=4200
 * old syntax is still working
 * norm can be "pal", "secam", "ntsc" or any hexa value

2003-07-21 Monday 23:53  fenrir

  * http: added "del" and "empty" control. (for playlist). Corrected
 "previous" command.

 Draw the text in the U and V planes as well. Removes the transparency effect.
 Also check which chroma is in use and give an error message if it isn't
 supported.

 Someone (possibly me) should write some renderer functions for other
 colorspaces.

2003-07-20 Sunday 15:33  gbazin

2003-07-20 Sunday 15:17  gbazin

 that ), add audio bitrate when available (untested)

2003-07-20 Sunday 12:22  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/preferences.cpp: windows can't have open _and_ save file dialogs so only use open file dialogs on win32 in the preferences menu.

 * Add -liconv to the ldflags of the spudec module.
 * Add -framework Carbon to the ldflags of the spudec module when Carbon is
   present. freetype-config unfortunatly omits this on MacOSX.

 I think I did this correctly, but it might be wise to review this :)

2003-07-18 Friday 20:52  gbazin

 * src/libvlc.h: disabled the encoders config options (encoders are not used anymore, all the encoding is done in the stream output transcode module).
 * src/misc/win32_specific.c: added an --high-priority config option on win32 to increase the priority of the process (default enabled for now so the behaviour isn't changed.)

    Dialog providers expose an api that allow other modules to use the GUI dialogs the module provides (open dialogs, etc...).
    + misc small enhancements.

 * modules/gui/skins/*: completely removed the dependancy on the wxwindows code (which also eliminates the need for the basic_skins module).
    The skins module will now try to load a "dialogs provider" to display the open, messages, file info and preferences dialogs.

   * modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: Select events in the video subwindow
     instead of the base window, because newer versions of Mozilla select
     ButtonPress for the window it gives us, and XSelectInput only allows
     one client to select this event.

 moved Doxyfile to doc/ to make sam happy. Changed Doxyfile so the generated
 documentation does not include information on which headers each file
 includes, since this information isn't correct.

 All: My shot at improving subtitle rendering in vlc. Now each vout uses a "text renderer" module to render text on the video when needed. I decieded to make this a module type, because other api's (win32 and macosx) is supposed to do better than freetype under some circumstances.

 include/video_output.h: added some members needed by text renderer modules
 src/video_output/video_output.c: load and unload text renderer module when needed
 src/video_output/video_text.c: implemented some functions to show text on the video
 include/osd.h: exported the functions to show text
 modules/misc/Modules.am, module/misc/freetype.c: new text renderer module, largly based on the old osdtext module.
 modules/video_filter/Modules.am, modules/video_filter/osd_text.c: removed the osdtext module
 configure.ac: changes "osdtext" to "freetype" some places
 modules/codec/spudec/*: when iconv is available, use it to convert textual subtitles from the encoding given by --sub-encoding to utf8. Use new code to render subtitles
 modules/control/lirc/lirc.c: use new code to give feedback on buttons pressed. untested.
 modules/demux/util/sub.c: remove all traces of the ugly old osdtext module
 modules/misc/dummy/*: added a "text renderer" submodule in the dummy module
 src/misc/modules.c: included osd.h as it seems to be needed to export symbols

 final notes: you need to give a proper value to --freetype-font. This should be the path to a font file freetype2 can handle (almost any format afaik) with a unicode translation table in it. Windows ttf files will do. In linux at least openoffice distributes some fonts that work. I think macosx and beos also has useable fonts.

2003-07-14 Monday 20:36  sigmunau

 toolbox: made a --add-include that can be used by doxygen to get proper
          includes in the .h files, since they are parsed out of context by
 	 doxygen
 Doxyfile: misc fixes, use ./toolbox --add-include as filter for sources.
 include/vlc_common.h: doxygenized VLC_COMMON_MEMBERS

 With these changes, and a slightly patched version of doxygen (which you can
 get here: http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~sigmunau/doxygen-vlcpatched.tgz ) you should
 be able to get some useful documentation out of the vlc sources.

2003-07-14 Monday 16:10  gbazin

 * configure.ac, modules/control/http.c: compilation fix for platforms without ctime_r().

 cleanup comments

2003-07-13 Sunday 12:35  massiot

 * modules/demux/mpeg: 0x06 stream type can be used for something else
   than A/52, so disabled it for the moment (we should actually check for
   the presence of a descriptor).

2003-07-13 Sunday 12:15  massiot

 * modules/codec/libmpeg2.c: Fixed a major bug where the picture heap
   would progressively empty on some DVDs.

2003-07-12 Saturday 13:33  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: added a "simple open" entry to the "File" menu of the interface and playlist. That entry just opens a wxFileDialog().

2003-07-12 Saturday 00:56  fenrir

  * http.c : fix definition conflict under OS X (at least).

2003-07-11 Friday 23:36  gbazin

 * modules/audio_output/directx.c: 5.1 audio output now works on sblive/audigy as well :)
 * modules/audio_output/waveout.c: fixed the waveOut plugin so works on NT4 as well... that complicates the plugin a bit more than I would have wanted, but hey.
 * modules/gui/wxwindows/messages.cpp: the verbose checkbox is set to the value of the --verbose config option.

          * another useless feature: can browse local files (for sout)

2003-07-11 Friday 11:58  gbazin

 * configure.ac: always use the built-in getop on win32 (cygwin's one is buggy).
     Disable the gtk2/gnome2 interfaces as they are currently unuseable and this option was confusing users more than anything else.
     Enabled the mp4 muxer (Although it doesn't yet produce streams compatible with quicktime).

  * all: samples pages for http interface.

2003-07-10 Thursday 22:24  fenrir

  * http: rework of the http interface.

  There is no more hardcoded html page. The interface recursively parse a
 directory, exporting all  files. All .htm/.html are  parsed, and special
 macro are  used. I will commit  somes samples pages in  share/http and I
 hope documentations.

  TODO: - (re)implement access control in httpd (but in a useable way).
        - clean login/password management. (for now .access protects
        a whole directory).
        - doc ;)

 * http: added support for user/pass (--http-user & --http-pass)

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/interface.cpp: resume after pause was broken recently.
 * src/audio_output/output.c: reverted a recent change that was screwing up the proper scheduling of audio samples after a starvation. That should improve the heavy resampling we currently have after a pause.
 * modules/audio_output/alsa.c: improvements and fixes to the alsa audio output.

2003-07-09 Wednesday 13:52  sam

   next title to next playlistitem. The old code for this was buggy. This

     that directory and "make medicacontrol.so") but untested.
   * src/playlist/playlist.c: Mostly harmless fix to playlist.c suggested by
     Olivier.

 Makefile.am: pass version strings to windres

 modules/gui/wxwindows/*: fix for the volume control under win32.

2003-06-13 Friday 12:08  gbazin

 * modules/misc/network/ipv6.c: fixed multicast support on win32. Well, it is working on Win2k but might require run-time OS version checking to have it woking on XP as well. (you might have to add a multicast route: ipv6 rtu FF00::/8 #intfnum)

 * msvc/vlc.dsw: added basic_skins and renamed mpeg_video into mpeg_video_old.
 * modules/codec/mpeg_video/parser.c: fixed segfault when idct/motion modules can't be loaded.

2003-06-10 Tuesday 23:01  massiot

 * configure.ac.in: Renamed mpeg_video to mpeg_video_old, so that even
   people who explicitely set mpeg_video in the previous version will end
   up with libmpeg2 in 0.6.0.
 * modules/codec/libmpeg2.c: Fixed a potential segfault, especially
   with DVDs.
 * modules/codec/lpcm.c: Send two PES packets in one aout buffer, because
   some audio filters (read: coreaudio resampler) don't like too small
   packets (I know, this is ugly).

2003-06-10 Tuesday 22:42  gbazin

 * modules/packetizer/mpegvideo.c, modules/mux/mpeg/*: fixed the dts/pts calculation in the mpegvideo packetizer. It should now handle streams where all the pictures don't have the same duration (eg. 3:2 pulldown). We don't calculate anymore the pts for every frame as it is impossible to do so for non low-delay streams.

2003-06-10 Tuesday 11:43  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in: added an --enable-mostly-builtin option to avoid having too many plugins.
 * modules/gui/skins/src/*: reverted the last BASIC_SKINS patch (BASIC_SKINS was not broken, the changes were done on purpose).

  Added a special access module for PVR MPEG-2 encoding boards.
  It allows to change the frequency and such things quite easily, from VLC.
  You'll have to --enable-pvr to build it.

 * OS X users can now browse the DVD menus with the arrow keys.

2003-06-03 Tuesday 22:21  hartman

 * When choosing a autogenerated menuitem, we now create a new thread to
   do the actual execution of this command. this is a (very ugly) workaround
   to the problem we were having with the deinterlace menu on osx.

   It works now, but now i'm running into the black screen and continous
   "late picture skipped (-218000)" again which is also plagueing us when you
   enter fullscreen with a filter enabled. This ought to be fixed before 0.6.0
   as well.

2003-06-03 Tuesday 22:20  gbazin

 * modules/gui/skins/src/*: oops, forgot to add a bunch of files.

2003-06-03 Tuesday 22:18  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: fixed bug in sout dialog box.
 * modules/gui/skins/*: factorised the wxwindows dialogs code in dialogs.cpp. wxWindows is also initialised earlier on to allow opening a skins file with a wxWin dialog box. (Note: I badly broke the GTK2 skins).

  * skins/controls/generic.h: Some public fields are now protected
  * skins/src/window.cpp:
     - Added a few debug messages
     - Invisible controls don't receive events anymore

 Note: There are still a few bugs in the code handling the controls and
 their different states, and I think they will be difficult to fix with
 the current code structure. A rewrite of this part of code could be a
 good idea (perhaps using states and transitions between states, like
 Zinf does?).

  muxer but this will break compatibility).

2003-05-31 Saturday 12:24  titer

  * src/input/input_ext-intf.c :  added an input_SetRate function; it is
    quite more convenient than, e.g, calling input_SetStatus( STATUS_FASTER )
    two times if you want to switch from 1:1 to 4:1 from the interface.
    Old functions still work.
  * modules/gui/beos/VlcWrapper.cpp : use it

2003-05-31 Saturday 01:23  fenrir

  * mjpeg grabbing added, thanks to Paul Forgey <paulf at aphrodite dot com>
  that had done all the work.

 Paul Forgey's notes:
 --------------------

 Unfortunatley, the v4l interface shows how much it sucks here.  I can't
 wait for v4l2 to become more common.  Anyway, the mjpeg mechanism
 captures completely differently than the uncompressed frame capture
 mechanism.  This means the code has to split off a bunch to do similar
 things depending on mjpeg being set or not.  For some reason, I can't
 use non v4l2 calls to capture uncompressed frames from the lml33,
 however I do have another bttv card on my system to test that I didn't
 break the non-mjpeg stuff.

 The Zoran encoders don't use square pixels.  So the 4:3 (or 16:9)
 picture is going to show up as 720x480.  I don't know my way around the
 code well enough to know how to specify a non-square pixel aspect
 ratio.  If there isn't a way to do it, it would be nice to be able to
 specify as an option the aspect ratio of the sourc.  Either 4:3 or 16:9
 in the case of anamorphic S-Video, which does occur.

 I stole the videodev_mjpeg.h header from the lavrec project.  Despite
 the linux kernels having support for the Zoran cards, there doesn't seem
 to be a reliable way to pick up this header, which is probably why
 lavrec did it this way.  Since it only defines ioctl definitions, I
 don't think using it is a legal problem.

 I also modified the audio handling a bit.  If the card supports audio,
 great, we'll set the card's parameters as we did before.  But if adev=
 is specified, use it regardless.  The reason to do this is to capture
 audio from the sound card with video coming from, say, a web cam or in
 my case, an encoder card which doesn't have any audio capabilities at
 all.

2003-05-26 Monday 19:26  gbazin

 * modules/video_output/directx/events.c: fixed breakage.

2003-05-26 Monday 19:06  gbazin

 * modules/audio_output/alsa.c: the aout-device obj var wasn't destroyed properly on probe() failure, preventing other audio plugins from working afterwards.
 * modules/gui/skins/src/skin_main.cpp: got rid of the skins shortcut.
 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: the popupmenu is not created inside the timer anymore so the slider will still be active when the popup is triggered.
 * modules/video_output/directx/events.c, modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c, src/playlist/playlist.c: new intf-popupmenu obj var to handle popup context menu requests from the vouts.

2003-05-26 Monday 16:06  gbazin

 * modules/gui/wxwindows/*: replaced the Advanced button with a checkbox. Small strings changes.

2003-05-26 Monday 14:59  hartman

 * modules/codec/quicktime.c: i had accidently upgraded this plugin to 100
 * modules/demux/avi/avi.c: fixed a spelling error reported by emulynx
 * modules/gui/macosx/intf.?: added a wrapString:toWidth function
 * modules/gui/macosx/prefs.?: removed the use of vlc_wraptext, because it
   was ugly. now we use our own, osx method. This fixes tooltips in japanese
   I'm not sure, but i think src/extras/libc.c vlc_wraptext is now unused.

2003-05-26 Monday 13:45  zorglub

 * The VLC-integrated SAP server now sends compliant packets. They can
   only be viewed with the CVS version of VLC

2003-05-26 Monday 02:09  gbazin

 * modules/gui/skins: got rid of init_lock and init_cond which aren't needed if you use vlc_thread_ready().
    started to implement X11Region and integrated the wxWindows dialogs.
 * configure.ac.in: the X11 skins are the default ones when you use --enable-skins. To select the GTK2 version, you also need to use --with-gtk2-skins.

2003-05-26 Monday 02:03  hartman

 * modules/gui/macosx/prefs.m: fixed the module selectors.
 * modules/video_filter/crop.c: clarified the use of crop. someone please
   check, i'm not entirely sure this is correct. Actually i think we should
   split this up in more then one config item, for GUI preferences clarity.
   Something like crop-width, crop-height, crop-h-offset, crop-v-offset, or
   like ffmpeg has which uses left, right, top and bottom offsets.

2003-05-26 Monday 01:25  hartman

 * extras/MacOSX/Resources/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib
 * modules/gui/macosx/output.m:
   - changed the textfields for bitrate into comboboxes with suggested values
     identical to the ones in wxwindows intf.
   - changed "bitrate (bps)" into "bitrate (kb/s)
 * modules/gui/macosx/prefs.?:
   - update the current view when advanced is changed.
   - module_lists now use the description strings.
   - always wraptext on tooltips. Currently japanese language is breaking.
   - we now have sliders for int/float config options with ranges.
   - fixed a warning message about an un-init'ed module_t.
 * modules/video_filter/adjust.c:
   - added the ranges to the description strings of the config options.
   - blur-factor now uses a range as according to it's description string
     it already should have used this.

2003-05-25 Sunday 23:08  titer

  modules/gui/beos/MediaControlView.cpp: fixed a strange crash that happens
    since the gettext behaviour changed

2003-05-25 Sunday 22:36  titer

  * bootstrap: remove a -shared flag as ./configure already adds it for
    platforms which need it
  * configure.ac.in: don't use -shared on BeOS

2003-05-25 Sunday 20:16  gbazin

 * configure.ac.in, modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: fixed configure check for the Xinerama extension.

2003-05-25 Sunday 18:02  nitrox

 . SAP/SDP packets parsing: ability to parse RFC compliant packets
   parse_sap returns the SAP header length
   parse_sdp only parse the SDP payload
   note that VLC will discard messages from the old miniSAP-server
   (You have to use CVS version of miniSAP-server)
   (Messages from the new miniSAP-server will be discarded with old VLC)

2003-05-25 Sunday 17:27  massiot

 * We now use UTF-8 internally under Mac OS X. This requires a libiconv-
 enabled version of gettext. (patch courtesy of the DJ)

2003-05-25 Sunday 17:21  titer

  modules/gui/beos/PreferencesWindow.* :
   * added a BBox around each panel (looks nicer)
   * now use BSliders for {integer,float}_with_range

2003-05-25 Sunday 11:31  gbazin

 * src/video_output/video_output.c, modules/video_output/directx/*, modules/video_output/x11/xcommon.c: fullscreen state is now attached to the input, so it will be remembered even if the vout is restarted (switching filters, dvd menus, etc...).
 * modules/video_filter/deinterlace/deinterlace.c: small change.

2003-05-25 Sunday 10:14  gbazin

2003-05-24 Saturday 12:55  jpsaman

2003-05-24 Saturday 12:10  sam

     default (Closes: #704).

2003-05-24 Saturday 11:53  sam

    * ./modules/access_output/udp.c: if the clock needs to be reset, we do not
      wait or we will face delay issues as reported in #794. Fix inspired from
      a suggestion by John Michael Zorko.

2003-05-24 Saturday 02:48  hartman

 * modules/gui/macosx/vout.m: removed some code that was preventing us from
   using chroma converters.
 * modules/codec/quicktime.c:
   - added the video decoder. only works with SVQ3 atm, returns Invalid
     BITMAPHEADER for some reason in all other cases.
   - did some cleaning up. this might just work under Win32 now aswell,
     gibalou will do some testing tomorrow ;)
   - SVQ3 QT degrades faster then the ffmpeg version, but also recovers
     faster. I'm not yet sure which one i prefer.

   since the problems with this decoder are endian specific according to it's creator.

2003-05-21 Wednesday 18:09  jpsaman

 Reverting previous --with-libmpeg2-prefix commit. Thanks Gildas for reminding me!

 * ALL: QT on OSX is not threadsafe in certain areas. i have found the proces

   So when we do this, only one thread at a time can use QT.
   Watching QT trailers is doable now, as soon as ffmpeg fix their altivec optimizations again ;)

   - This module provides QDM2 and QDMC sound support on OSX by linking to
     the native QT libraries. We now have FULL QT trailer support on OSX.

  (this silly GDK doesn't know BMP images :(

2003-04-13 Sunday 20:00  fenrir

  * all: new sout scheme. Now a chain of module are created that can
 modify/apply on all streams, --sout has the same behavour expect when
 starting with a '#'.

  With a starting '#' you can specify a chain of modules, it's still
 unstable but a lot more powerfull.
  You have access to duplicate(that duplicate all stream), transcode
 (using only ffmpeg), standard/std and es (that apply muxers and access),
 and display. You could chain them with ':' and specify options with
 {option1=value,option2=value[,...]}.

 ex: * to stream and see the stream to udp/ts:ip
  --sout '#duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,url=ip}}'
     * to transcode,see and stream
  --sout '#transcode{acodec=mpga}:duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,url=ip}}'

  Without a starting '#', the url is converted into '#std{acces=,mux=,url}'
 Test and report bugs :)

 * user-friendly(?) build system, based on linux Menuconfig script.
   Just run ./menuconfig and ./build-vlc (or just ./build-vlc)

    plugins matching the given shortcuts list, unless "none" is closing the

    Which means that users will stop complaining vlc doesn't launch anymore
    or can't play anything after they have fiddled with their config
    options :))

2003-03-25 Tuesday 00:43  gbazin

2003-03-24 Monday 23:50  gbazin

 * modules/access/*: don't forget to reinitialize the timeout when looping around select().

2003-03-24 Monday 17:15  gbazin

 * modules/access/*: pf_read() in access modules is now blocking. We still

    assume that pf_read() == 0 means EOF.

 * src/input/input_ext-plugins.c, src/input/input.c: fixed the infinite loop
    of "decoder stuck" messages that sometimes happened.

    warnings.

 * a new directory access module. It parses a directory with dirent and builds
   a m3u 'file' which it feeds to the m3u demuxer.
   Problems: - it requires a dir to end with /
             - if i enabled it, all files would use the m3u demuxer for some
             strange reason. i've spent a day hunting this down, reboot-
             strapping and doing who knows what. I'm sick of it now.
             Someone else can give it a try, if he wants to.

   Reworked the mouse hiding routine. we were always hiding the mousecursor
   on kCGDirectMainDisplay, but this display is always the one with the
   menubar and not always the one containing our VLCVout.
   This new code takes the vout, and calculates on which displays (plural
   because of possible mirroring) it is being shown. It then shows or hides
   the cursor on all of those displays.
   This should fix #396.

 NEWS: added note about .pls handeling and the http audio fix

2003-03-06 Thursday 23:10  gbazin

 * src/audio_output/dec.c, include/aout_internal.h: the aout core was
 automatically discarding audio samples that were above AOUT_MAX_ADVANCE_TIME
 in the future. Problem is that p_input->i_pts_delay isn't a fixed value. We
 now fetch this value from the input thread when we create an aout_instance_t.
 This solves problems with the http access plugin.

 * modules/gui/macosx/applescript.?
 * extras/MacOSX/Resources/vlc.scriptSuite
 * extras/MacOSX/Resources/English.lproj/vlc.scriptTerminology
   - moved existing applescript commands to these files
   - added several control commands. supported are: play/pause, stop,
     previous, next, fullscreen, mute, volumeUp and volumeDown.
     These correspond to the existing menuitems. This still requires work
     in the future to make it more correct AppleScript, but it works for now.

 * modules/gui/macosx/controls.?
   - split up the controls.m into a .m and a .h

 * modules/gui/macosx/intf.?

2003-03-05 Wednesday 17:55  gbazin

 * src/input/input_ext-plugins.c: added an msleep() call in case we fail to
    allocate a new buffer in input_FillBuffer(). This is necessary because
    the input thread has an high priority and we don't want it to loop
    without any interruption.

2003-03-05 Wednesday 00:11  massiot

 ALL:

2003-02-20 Thursday 01:52  sigmunau

 * include/configuration.h: added a new flag to the configuration stucture to
 indicate wether it is an "advanced" option or not. The goal with this is to
 hide the user from all the strange options that very seldom needs to be
 changed. added an extra argument to all the add_* macros to indicate wether
 the item is advanced or not.
 * src/libvlc.h: added an "show advanced options" config option default
 disabled
 * src/libvlc.c: the advanced options are not listed by vlc --help and
 friends unless --advanced is used
 * modules/gtk/preferences.c: the gtk/gnome preferences dialog don't show
 advanced options unless advanced is set
 all: set the advanced flag to VLC_FALSE or VLC_TRUE for all options, by
 using some common sense. Please check and correct

 note: All interfaces should still work like they used to, see the change in
 modules/gtk/preferences.c to find out how to "hide" options.

 second note: I think I've changed all the modules, but I could not test
 everyone for compilation, expect some broken modules (the fix is to add ",
 VLC_TRUE" as last argument to the add_* I forgot)

  *: a new mouse gestures interface, currently supporting back, forward, quit
 fullscreen and a nice debug message when you draw a clockwise square. Video
 output modules needs to be modified for this to work, but it should be minor

 modules/gui/beos/PreferenceWindow.h/.cpp

 	- added settings for screenshot path and image format

 	- removed "Save" button, added "Cancel" and "Revert" buttons

 	- added revert functionality

 	- changed class design for cleaner functionality,
 		separated ApplyChanges() into more functions
 		to have finer control

 	- added more error checking and fixed memory leaks
 		(config_GetPsz() returns char*, not const char*!)

 	- all settings are now correctly saved and restored

 	- some more cosmetic changes

 modules/gui/beos/InterfaceWindow.h/.cpp

 	- updated vlc way of saving settings to be on par with BeOS way
 		and made it selectable in the code which way is used.
 		However, the VideoSettings are still only savable in
 		the BeOS way.

 	- if dvd menus are used, the navigation menu enables a
 		"Goto Menu" item. Unfortunately, I don't see a clean
 		way to really detect the usage of dvd/dvdold in the
 		currently playing stream. I wouldn't want to see
 		if a playlist item has "dvd:" or "dvdold:" prepended
 		at each interface update.

 * modules/codec/spudec/spudec.c, modules/codec/spudec/text.c: fixed the
    race condition between spudec and vout. This patch may not be all that
    nice because it does a lot of vlc_object_find() but it is the only
    solution I've been able to come-up with.
    Oh and I didn't fix the memory leak caused by the font when using text
    subtitles. If the vout changes while the spudec is running then we don't
    unload this font.

 switching deinterlace modes on the fly.

  * src/misc/objects.c: vlc_list_find now returns a (vlc_list_t *)
    instead of a (vlc_list_t); this modification was needed because BCB
