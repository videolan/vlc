  * ./configure.in: better detection of IPv6, fixed solaris handling.
  * ./plugins/familiar/*: used buttons instead of pixmaps.
  * ./share/vlc16x16.xpm: XPM version of the logo.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_es.c: fixed a segfault when no decoder was

  * ./po/se.po : Swedish translation, courtesy of Joel Arvidsson
    <dogai@privat.utfors.se>.
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.h: added a new fourcc (3IV2, you shoudln't be able
    to decode it but sometimes it's in fact MPEG-4, thx titer).
  * ./plugins/mp4/*: added capability to read mov with mp3 tracks. But it seems
    that mad doesn't like too much fragmented data packets, and thus breaks the
    audio.
  * ./mozilla/Makefile: fixed dependencies on .h files.
  * ./plugins/filter/distort.c: fixed a typo in option names.
  * ./plugins/dummy/dec_dummy.c: new dummy decoder, for testing purposes.

  * ./mozilla/vlcplugin.h: added .mov and .mp4 files to the plugin.
  * ./Makefile: we no longer try to merge .a files into libvlc.a, but rather
    add them to the vlc-config output.
  * ./plugins/dvdplay/*: first version of plugin for libdvdplay; supports DVD
    reading with title and menus, pause, seeking, interactive menus with
    mouse control.
  * ./plugins/gtk/*: allowed 0 for title selection as it is the area for first
    play pgc in DVDs.
  * ./plugins/familiar/*: interface neatly exits now.
  * ./plugins/cinepak/cinepak.c: added a new fourcc.

    ffmpeg is initialized.
  * ./plugins/beos/InterfaceWindow.cpp: implemented muting.
  * ./plugins/beos/InterfaceWindow.cpp: fixed code for subtitle and audio
    selection, still probs but working.
  * ./plugins/beos/*: changes to ensure BeOS plugins compile and function,
    implemented a intf_vlc_wrapper to "shield" the BeOS code from the
    underlying vlc structurs, yet to be completed.
  * ALL: decoders now use a fourcc as a probe value.
  * include/input_ext-intf.h: killed p_es->b_audio, since i_cat already fills
    its purpose.
  * include/input_ext-intf.h: killed p_es->i_type in favour of p_es->i_fourcc.
  * include/video.h: killed p_pic->p_plane->b_margin; now i_visible_pitch is
    always valid.                                                           
  * ./src/libvlc.h: replaced --mpeg-adec and --ac3-adec with --codec; see
    vlc --help for more information.
  * include/video.h: removed fourcc values which should _not_ be global
    (thanks fenrir for convincing me).
  * ALL: video output plugins use the VLC_FOURCC macro to build their fourccs.
  * ./plugins/beos/InterfaceWindow.cpp: removed the last remaining call to
    input_ChangeES.
  * ./src/input/input_info.c, ./src/misc/messages.c: initialized the first 
    vasprintf arguments to NULL for extra safety.
  * ./src/misc/modules.c: added the "any" and "none" keywords to the module
    selection string. "any" matches any module, and "none" always fails.   
  * ./src/input/input_info.c: win32 compilation fixes.
  * ./plugins/familiar/familiar.c: fixed gtk core-dump on exit. Used code from
    gtk plugin for this.
  * ./share/*: VCR icon buttons for Familiar Linux interface.
  * ./plugins/familiar/*: Familiar Linux interface (non functional yet).
  * ./plugins/memcpy/fastmemcpy.h: commented out suspicious code.

  * ./plugins/mp4/mp4.c: can now read mp4 files with mp3 audio declared in
    mp4a box.
  * ./src/libvlc.c: updated usage info to include STRING_FROM_LIST
    configuration items.                                          
  * ./src/input/input_info.c: new input info subsystem.
  * ./plugins/mp4/*: same endianness for fourcc as the ones in video.h.
  * ./plugins/cinepak/*: take care of grayscale option.
  * ./debian/control: changed "interface plugin" occurences to "frontend" to
    make package descriptions less misleading.                              
  * ./bootstrap.sh: use C locale for generating vlc_symbols.h.
  * ./bootstrap.sh: don't generate pofiles by default.
  * ./plugins/cinepak/*: a cinepak (cvid) video decoder (codec found in old
    .mov files).
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: tried to add an option to allow frame droppping
    (--enable-hurry-up). Begin to work.
  * ./configure.in: added -lrt for HP/UX port.
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: added a new option, to set the level of error
    resilience. It allows to play badly encoded mpeg4 files (illegal VLC code).
  * ALL: changed "struct foo_s" into "struct foo_t" to make greppers happy.
  * ./src/libvlc.c, ./include/vlc/vlc.h: created reentrant versions of the
    libvlc API.                                                           
  * ./src/vlc.c: vlc uses the non-reentrant libvlc functions.
  * ./mozilla/vlcplugin.c: the mozilla plugin uses the reentrant functions.
  * ./debian/*: created packages for libvlc0-dev.
  * ./plugins/a52/a52.c: added a global lock to prevent two VLC threads to
    call a liba52 function simultaneously (liba52 isn't reentrant).
  * ./plugins/a52/a52.c: made liba52 the default AC3 decoder.
  * ./configure.in: we no longer check for a specific function in -lphtread
    because some systems (such as HP-UX...) have them inlined.
  * ./Makefile.modules: we don't chmod -x the compiled plugins because of
    HP-UX's dynamic linker which would otherwise be unable to open them. 
  * ./configure: rebuilt using the newest autotools.
  * ./src/vlc.c, ./src/libvlc.c: added more robust consistency checks.
  * ./configure.in: fixed description of MP4 module.

    machines.
  * ./include/vlc/vlc.h: included os_specific.h.
  * ./include/interface.h: interface creation and destruction functions are
    now exported to plugins so that any plugin can spawn a new interface.
  * ./plugins/mp4/*: preliminary mp4 (and some mov) demux plugin. I've not
    enabled it (add by hand to Makefile... and link it with zlib -lz) as I
    will probably break it too many times. It work for some mp4 (but without
    audio, need aac decoder) and mov with sorenson v1(ffmpeg :).
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed a bug in the computation of the mouse
    coordinates sent to interface.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: added a 'dvdold' shortcut to force the use of the
    dvd plugin in case another plugin with higher priority wants to use 'dvd'
    as shortcut.
  * ./plugins/lpcm_adec/lpcm_adec.c: the loop in lpcm decoder DecodeFrame()
    could not exit after b_die in some cases.
  * ./configure.in: plugin compilation fix for HP-UX.
  * ./configure.in: better protection of CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. Should also fix
    remaining issues with XvPutImage detection, please confirm!
  * ./plugins/alsa/alsa.c: ALSA device selection patch, courtesy of John
    Paul Lorenti <jpl31@columbia.edu>.
  * ./Makefile: src/misc/modules_builtin.h now depends on Makefile.config.
  * ./src/misc/threads.c: improved lazy initialization of the global lock.
  * ./doc/fortunes.txt: a few IRC fortune cookies for those with too much
    time on their hands.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/video_parser.c, ./src/input/input_programs.c: fixed
    a few uninitialized variables.                                         
  * MacOS X: added deinterlace submenu.
  * ./plugins/access/http.c: fixed a double free bug and a memory leak.
  * ./plugins/*: interface plugins set p_vlc->b_die to quit vlc, but check
    for p_intf->b_die to know when they are supposed to terminate p_intf. This
    will allow to spawn interface plugins on the fly.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: quick hack to read file created by ffmpeg. I think
    it should work.
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: added support for some others codecs provided
    by ffmpeg, but some of them aren't tested.
  * ./src/misc/messages.c: debug messages that were issued before the -v
    flag was tested for are no longer lost.
  * ./configure.in: we now look for XvPutImage instead of XvSetPortAttribute
    because XvSetPortAttribute isn't always available.                      
  * ./plugins/macosx/vout_macosx.m: added missing arrow up/down handling.   
  * MacOS X: added messages and playlist panel, dock menu, context menu 
    in video view and localization support.

    up-to-date.
  * ./MAINTAINERS: new file indicating who has knowledge on which parts.
  * ./po/*: polish translation, courtesy of Arkadiusz Lipiec.
  * ./README: removed much outdated data.
  * ./debian/*: great package renaming - names should make more sense now.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_libmad.c: prevent the MAD decoder from looping endlessly
    when the audio output fifo could not be created.
  * ./plugins/gtk/*: new generic "Open Target" window. Please test and
    comment on usability.
  * ./debian/rules: the Debian package creation script builds ffmpeg.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_audio.c: we skip the ID3 tag at the begining
    of an MP3, so more files can be read.

  * ./plugins/gnome/gtk.c, ./plugins/gnome/gnome.c: prevent older versions
    of vlc from crashing when trying to open a recent module.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: to enter fullscreen mode, we create a new window
    instead of moving the current window, which saves us the hassle of
    remembering size and position.                                    
  * ./plugins/x11/x11.c, ./plugins/x11/xvideo.c: added --no-x11-shm and
    --no-xvideo-shm options.                                           
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: begin to support VOD, but it segfault very quickly
    (unless you disable audio or video!) and cannot support seeking( will
    just stop ). Moreover it can't work for all files, only interleaved ones.

  * ./src/misc/messages.c: cosmetic enhancements in the message output.
  * ./plugins/x11/*: added the --x11-drawable and --xvideo-drawable options to
    tell vlc to draw in an existing drawable instead of creating a new window.
  * ./plugins/avi/*: I rewrite the way to read, in order to minimize seeking
    (faster and in prevision of VOD by http, but not yet functionnal ). But
    sound becomes horrible, I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
  * ./plugins/macosx/vout_vlc_wrapper.m: arrow-up and arrow-down allow to 
    control the sound volume.
  * ./plugins/access/http.c: for streams which are not seekable, we fall
    back on old HTTP/1.0 behavior; on systems implementing atoll() we
    can also read files > 2 GB.

    configuration macro.
  * ./include/modules.h, ./include/video_output.h,
    ./src/video_output/video_output.c, ./plugins/filters/*: added a
    VOUT_FILTER capability. Having a clear distinction between VOUTs and
    VOUT_FILTERs allows us to get rid of ugly hacks. The filters are also
    stackable now (use --filter=foo:bar:foo etc..).
  * ./include/configuration.h, ./src/libvlc.h, ./src/libvlc.c: clean-up +
    added an ADD_USAGE_HINT() configuration macro.
  * ./FAQ: added QT6 FAQ entry.
  * ./configure.in: fixed inet_pton detection.
  * ./plugins/filter/deinterlace.c: the blend mode is now a lot smoother, but
    also a bit slower, so I also kept the old version, optimized it, and     
    called it "mean".

  * ./configure.in: checking for the header should be enough in most cases.
  * ./plugins/xosd/xosd.c: configuration options.

    the "File" menu, it is automatically played.
  * ./include/vlc_objects.h: pointers are set to NULL after a call to
    vlc_object_destroy.
  * ./po/pl.po: updated polish translation, thanks to Arkadiusz Lipiec
    <alipiec@adrenalina.pl>.
  * ./src/playlist/playlist.c: lots of playlist behaviour enhancements.
  * ./src/misc/objects.c: we do not hang on attempt to destroy an object with
    a non-zero reference count, but we still complain.

    as play, pause, stop, next, fast etc. work again.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gnome_*: got rid of lots of useless wrappers which were a
    workaround for a bug in Glade. Instead, bootstrap.sh does the Glade fixes.
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: if there is already a video output with the
    appropriate properties, we use it.
  * ./Makefile: minor fix for the BeOS' make-package (icon loss).

    plugin.
  * ./include/threads_funcs.h: fixed the --fast-mutex option.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.*: the directx vout plugin now uses the
    IID_IDirectDrawSurface2 interface, this shouldn't break anything and we
    should now support WinNT4+DirectX3. Added support for YUY2 overlays because
    a few graphics cards only support this. Some code cleanup too.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: small bugfix.
  * ./plugins/network/ipv6.c: attempt to fix the win32 IPv6 implementation.
    Multicast should even work (untested) although we'll need to find a way to
    replace if_nametoindex() to have a fully functionnal win32 port.
  * ./include/threads.h, ./include/threads_funcs.h: reverted Win32 pthread
    implementation to the old code. Fixed vlc_cond_broadcast() for WinNT/2K/XP.
    Additional vlc_cond_* implementations for Win9x.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: renamed --fast_pthread option into --fast-mutex.
    Added a--win9x-cv-method option to choose which vlc_cond_* implementation
    we want on Win9x.

    pointer.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c: compilation fix.

    channels.
  * ./src/interface/intf_eject.c: added ejection code for Win32.
  * ./plugins/win32/*: enabled the "Eject" button (thanks Ipkiss).
  * ./include/configuration.h: changed ADD_BOOL and ADD_BOOL_WITH_SHORT config
    macros to accept a default value as an argument.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: modified the command line parsing to accept
    --foo and --no-foo when a "foo" boolean config option is defined.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: modified the help menu to indicate whether the
    option is enabled or disabled by default.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: when the video output hasn't received
    a new picture for a while, it redisplays the last displayed one. This will
    be useful for DVD menus, but also solves the "picture becomes black when
    vlc is paused" issue.
  * ./plugins/dummy/dummy.c: added a CATEGORY_HINT to the config.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: small change to the ToggleFullscreen routine
    to avoid a flickering during the switch.

    mpeg_system.c and no longer in ac3 audio decoder).
  * src/misc/netutils.c: tests if message from vlcs begins with 'E:' or 'I:'
    instead of testing 'E: ' and 'I: ' (to simplify miniVLCS).
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c, ./plugins/avi/libioRIFF.c: added more safety tests.
  * ./include/inpu_ext-dec.h: added a check to fifo->b_die after the call

  * ./plugins/access/http.c: fixed HTTP input under Win32
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_yuy2.h: bugfix for the I420 to YUY2 MMX chroma
    transformations, with the help of Pascal Levesque.
  * ./plugins/directx/directx.c: UnregisterClass() in MODULE_DEACTIVATE. If
    we don't do this, trying to use the class when the plugin is reloaded will
    cause a segfault.
  * win32: replaced TUpDown components by TCSpinEdit ones, which allow
    values greater than 32767. It fixes the audio bug ocurring when a
    configuration file is saved under the win32 interface
  * ./plugins/win32/mainframe.cpp: Added some extra space between
    statusbar and toolbar when nothing is displayed.
  * ./plugins/text/logger.c: on win32 the logger interface shows up a dos
    command box.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c: fixed uninitialized variable
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_playlist.c: simplified GtkRebuildCList()
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: changes to reduce segfaults on exit,
    and also allow only one Playlist window.
  * ./include/modules_inner.h: fixed a crash when reopening a hidden
    module
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_access.c: on Win32 the DVD access plugin has to be
    explicitly requested. This avoids crashes when the input thread tries
    to open files as dvds.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_access.c: fixed a side-effect bug causing crashes
    on DVD title change
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_yuy2.c: margin support for the 420 planar to 422
    packed chroma transformations.
  * ./src/input/input.c: fixed a bug with the input remaining stuck when no
    network data was present.
  * win32: fixed a stupid bug in the Network dialog.

  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed x11 and xvideo alternate fullscreen.
  * ./plugins/network/ipv6.c: experimental support for Windows IPv6
  * ./plugins/a52/a52.c: added an option to disable the dynamic range
    compression.
  * ./Makefile.opts.in: removed configuration stuff which does not need to
    rebuild anything to Makefile.config, so that editing it will not cause
    a complete rebuild.
  * ./plugins/beos/VideoWindow.h, ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: improved
    Overlay and Bitmap output modes.
  * ./plugins/macosx/aout_macosx.m, ./plugins/macosx/aout_macosx.m: removed
    unused headers.
  * ./plugins/macosx/intf_controller.[mh]: you can now drag & drop files onto
    the vlc dock icon. CFBundleDocumentTypes in Info.plist doesn't seem to have
    any effect, so you'll have to hold down command-option when dropping until
    this is resolved.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: removed previous patch to the video
    output since it causes problems for some people.
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: worked around a bug in seeking.
  * ./include/threads_func.h: OS X port now uses real-time threads.
  * ./configure.in: fixes for ffmpeg and mad.
  * ./extras/MacOSX/Resources/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib/objects.nib: OS X intf
    is now more consistent with Apple guidelines.

    a disc to eject.
  * ./plugins/macosx/intf_vlc_wrapper.m: fixed a segfault in the Mac OS X
    interface.
  * ./plugins/satellite/input_satellite.c: cosmetic changes in error messages.
  * ./plugins/gtk/*: gtk and gnome interfaces now use frequency and symbol
    rate default values.
  * ./BUGS: removed fixed entries.
  * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: initialize p_spudec->p_vout to NULL to
    prevent segfaults if InitThread does not complete.
  * ./plugins/text/rc.c: on win32 the rc plugin opens a new console.
  * ./plugins/filters/*: filters were using memalign but freeing p_data instead
    of p_data_orig.
  * ./extras/Win32_msvc/vlc.dsp: updated MSVC++ project.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: small corrections to the LONGTEXT descriptions in
    main.c.
  * ./AUTHORS: a few additions.
  * ./vlc.spec: updates, courtesy of Yves Duret <yves.duret@mandrakesoft.com>.
  * ./configure.in: new --with-ffmpeg option for standard installations.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: updated long descriptions.
  * ./plugins/dummy/intf_dummy.c: on win32 the dummy interface plugin will
    open a dos command box. With this fix, vlc should never fail silently and
    leave a ghost process running in the background when there isn't any
    working GUI plugin.
  * ./include/config.h: on win32 DVD/VCD_DEVICE defaults to to D:.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: added a few *_LONGTEXT descriptions.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/video_parser.c: moved the mpeg-motion and mpeg-idct
     options to the mpeg_vdec plugin.
  * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: mark subpictures destroyed when we end
    spudec thread.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_pcm.c: desperate attempt to improve audio output.
  * ./doc/vlc-howto.sgml, ./doc/vlc.1, ./README.MacOSX.rtf: updated
    documentation.
  * ./INSTALL.win32: updated INSTALL.win32.
  * ./plguins/directx/vout_directx.c, ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: a little
    bit of clean-up in the directx video output plugin
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: fixed Mac OS X resizing.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: warning levels are no longer additive, patch
    courtesy of Arnaud de Bossoreille de Ribou <bozo@via.ecp.fr>.
  * ALL: changed __inline__ with inline (autoconf does the job for us anyway,
    and mipspro doesn't know about __inline__).
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_pcm.c, ./src/audio_output/aout_ext-dec.c: fixed
    deadlock in NextFrame() in aout_pcm.c.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c, ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: fixed
    a bug in the directx window creation function. We register a window
    class once per process so we must be careful not to free the associated
    resources.
  * ./extras/Win32_msvc/vlc.dsp: updated the MSVC++ project files and added
    support for dirent (vlc compiled with msvc can now load plugins - even
    compiled with mingw).
  * ALL: small portability fixes.
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: menu item to maximize the volume in Mac OS X.
  * ALL: dropped dependancy on autoconf 2.52.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: modified the directx video plugin to try
    to create an YUV surface before falling back to an RGB surface when it's
    not possible to use overlays. Some graphic cards can do the YUV->RGB
    conversion in hardware during the blitting stage.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: in the directx video plugin, we now
    request that the RGB surface be created in video memory. The reasoning
    behind this is that usually surfaces in video memory benefit from more
    hardware acceleration (like for instance hw rescaling, hw blitting, etc.).
  * ./plugins/directx/directx.c: added two options to the directx video plugin
    to disable the above features (mainly because my video driver is buggy and
    doesn't handle them well).
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: small cosmetic changes to the generation of
    the config file.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: fix for config_GetHomeDir() on win32.
    SHGetFolderPath() is located in shfolder.dll not shell32.dll.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: fix for the gtk preferences dialog box. To
    be sure that an int or float value is actually changed we call
   gtk_spin_button_update() in the GtkInt/FloatChanged() event handler.
  * ./debian/control: made the Build-Depends: entry a one-liner (Closes
    Debian bug #147103).
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_spdif.c: a lock was not released.
  * ./plugins/text/rc.c: added a safety lock.
  * ./plugins/gtk/*: new Network dialog box for Gtk and Gnome interfaces.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_audio.c: you can now force the mpeg_audio demux
    module.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/vpar_headers.c: update reference in case of sequence
    end code.
  * ./src/input/input_clock.c: don't keep the control lock during the pause.
  * ./plugins/ac3_spdif/ac3_spdif.c, ./src/audio_output/aout_spdif.c: check for
    b_die and b_error in all loops so that we don't remain stuck waiting for
    data whereas the vlc has tried to quit.
  * ./src/misc/mtime.c: we use nanosleep whenever possible (patch from Meuuh).
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c : it will not segfault with broken avi with an unknown
    stream.
  * ./src/misc/mtime.c: removed usage of usleep (not thread safe) (by Meuuh).
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: video output patch to improve handling
    of late pictures (by Meuuh).
  * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c, src/interface/intf_playlist.c: disabled
    calls to realloc(_,0) in a similar way to input_programs.c.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_seek.c: fix random segfaults on title change (i_cell
    should be tested _before_ we access the structures).
  * ./src/input/input_programs.c: fixed memory corruption by setting a few
    pointers to NULL after they have been free()ed.
  * ./src/input/input_programs.c: removed now useless ASSERTs.
  * ./plugins/beos/*: improved overlay and bitmap support, not tested on nVidia
    cards. Lower CPU usage and no thread created per frame.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_summary.c: added a sanity check.
  * ./plugins/vcd/*: vcd access plugin now uses mpeg_ps demux instead of its
    own one.
  * ./plugins/macosx/vout_qdview.m: attempt to fix the video output with
    QuickTime 6.
  * ./plugins/ac3_adec/ac3_adec.c: probably fixed most "crash when changing
    audio track" problems by zeroing the p_ac3dec structure.
  * ./plugins/ac3_adec/ac3_adec.c: fixed a "INPUT_MAX_ALLOCATION reached"
    crash.
  * ./src/input/input_dec.c, ./src/input/input_programs.c: check size to avoid
    realloc(0).
  * ./plugins/win32/network.*: new Network dialog box.
  * ./src/input/input.c, ./plugins/access/http.c, ./plugins/access/udp.c: added
    the input_FDNetworkClose() function to be called when closing a networking
    stream instead of input_FDClose().
  * ./src/misc/netutils.c: use closesocket() instead of close() at the end
    of the network_ChannelJoin() for WIN32.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: fixed an issue with long options from
    modules where option arguments and playlist entries were mixed.
  * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: fixed endianness issue; subtitles colors
    should be OK now.
  * ./plugins/satellite/input_satellite.c: fixed a compilation warning.
  * ./configure.in: added libdvbpsi version check.
  * ./include/modules_inner.h: fixed a bug in module reinitialization,
    which should fix crashes after a long pause.
  * ./src/input/*: fixed a bug (glitch/segfault) when seeking.
  * ./src/input/mpeg_system.c: we handle PCR even if they are not attached
    to a PMT.
  * ./configure.in: new --with-mad-tree configure option.
  * ./BUGS: updated BUGS file.
  * ./src/input/mpeg_system.c: it should now be possible to quit when reading
    a bogus file.
  * ./src/misc/iso-639.def, ./include/iso_lang.h, ./src/misc/iso_lang.c:
    iso-839-[12] tools.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_es.c, ./plugins/dvd/dvd_summary.c,
    ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: adapted DecodeLanguage calls to the new
    behaviour.
  * plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_ts.c: ISO-639-2 descriptors handling.
  * ./include/mmx.h, ./plugins/imdct/*: gcc-3.1 compilation fixes courtesy
    of Yves Duret and other Mandrakesoft guys I don't know.
  * ./plugins/macosx/intf_vlc_wrapper.m: do not eject when we're reading from
    the disc...
  * ./src/misc/modules.c: if a module has a zero-scored capability, we don't
    try to use it, unless it was explicitely requested (--vout for example).
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: fixed an aspect ratio issue (thanks Meuuh). 
  * ./src/input/mpeg_system.c: fixed an old old bug in TS demux, thank you
    Meuuh.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_audio.c: to avoid problem with PS, test only the
    first 4 bytes for mpeg header so some broken files, and all web radio will
    not work. You can change this by changing value of MPEGAUDIO_MAXTESTPOS.
  * ./doc/vlc-howto.sgml: spelling mistakes, small updates, harmonization with
    other documentations (thank you Alexis).
  * ./plugins/satellite/*: some fixes in options parsing (thank you Sam).
  * ./extras/MacOSX/Resources/vlc.icns: new OS X icon, courtesy of Joeri van
    Dooren <joeri@van.dooren.be>.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/video_decoder.c: Mac OS X fix.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_audio.c: you should again be able to play PS
    streams (I hope it will be enough). Sorry.
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: CVS version of ffmpeg can now decode
    msmpeg4 v1 v2, so I added support for this. But you can always use
    the old ffmpeg library without any problem (I hope ;).
  * ./include/video.h : added new fourcc codes for avi.
  * ./plugins/filter/clone.c: New filter, `--filter clone', duplicates
    display. To duplicate 12 times, use `--filter clone:12'.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c, ./plugins/x11/xvideo.c: --xvideo-chroma flag to
    force the XVimage format used.
  * ./plugins/text/ncurses.c: ncurses interface improvements by Thomas Graf.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_audio.c: we don't use any more U32_AT.

    input_ClockGetTS for plugins.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_audio.c: a demux for mpeg audio stream (file,
    web radio ...) 
  * ./src/interface/main.c: if Ctrl-C doesn't kill vlc cleanly for any
    reason, user just needs to hit Ctrl-C again 1 second later and we'll
    exit disgustingly instead of freezing.
  * ./plugins/macosx/intf_vlc_wrapper.c: menu code fixes.
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: fixed Mac OS X VOUT_SIZE_CHANGE signal.
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: corrected some bad lock/unlock.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: can now use --novideo.
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: improvements of the OS X GUI.
  * ./plugins/mad/*: added mad plugin downscale config option for selecting
    downscaling routine. Choices are: fast, mpg321. Default the fast version
    is used. The downscale option mpg321 uses an algorithm that adapts to
    dither errors. This routine is borrowed from MPG321 code.
  * ./plugins/mad/*.c: mono audio streams get now duplicated on the right
    channel instead of silencing the right channel (untested).
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c, ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: improvements.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: video plugins that don't handle
    rescaling themselves have to let the video_output thread know about
    resizing events (with VOUT_SIZE_CHANGE event). (this part needs some
    clean-up but it is basically working for the X11 and SDL plugins).
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: fixed fullscreen for the SDL plugin.
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c, ./plugins/mga/xmga.c: xmga and sdl now switch to
    fullscreen on double-click.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: try to not freeze when reaching end file.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c, ./src/video_output.c: fixed the resizing and
    scaling of the X11 video output.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: clicking on the video doesn't pause it anymore
    (use spacebar for this), but double-clicking will now switch between
    fullscreen and window mode.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: the Apply button in the preferences menu
    is grayed out unless there's a change to apply.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: GtkConfigApply() now clears the list of
    config changes before returning.
  * ./plugins/network/ipv4.c: fixed ipv4.so compilation under QNX.
  * ./configure.in: deactivated ipv6.so under QNX for now.
  * ./plugins/macosx/aout_macosx.c: more stable audio output with more output
    buffering.
  * ./BUGS: no text in the status bar with gtk intf, no window title in gtk
    intf on some machines, correct title on another.
  * ./plugins/gtk/*.glade, ./plugins/gtk/*_interface.*: fix for interface   
    autoshrink when toolbar text isn't displayed.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c, ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c, ./plugins/gtk/gtk_display.*:
    callbacks for the hide tooltips and toolbar text options.
  * ./plugins/mad/*: aout fifo adapts it size according to the length of the
    first frame. The change is needed for MPEG1/2 layer III, because the size
    of output pcm from mad_decoder is different.
  * ./include/modules_inner.h, ./src/misc/configuration.c: support for config
    options callbacks.
  * ./configure.in: we check support for variadic macros (screw Borland!).
  * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c: new option lets you hide the text of the
    GNOME interface toolbar.
  * ./FAQ: small FAQ update. Please note that everyone can update this FAQ if
    they want, it is not my property :-).
  * ./AUTHORS: added quite a few missing names.
  * ./plugins/qnx/vout_qnx.c: port of the QNX vout plugin to the vout4 API,
    courtesy of Pascal Levesque <Pascal.Levesque@mindready.com>.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: you can now use slow and fast reading. After seeking,
    audio and video synchro is better.
  * ./plugins/macosx/aout_macosx.c: misc sound fixes.
  * ./configure.in: fixed VCD double detection.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c, ./plugins/text/logger.c: the configuration file
    and the log file are opened in text mode. This mode should only have a
    meaning on Win32 and isn't supposed to break any other platform. If does
    give you any trouble then shout.
  * ./configure.in: added a --with-a52-tree option to the configure script.
  * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: FOURCC_YUY2 subtitles support (for NVidia
    overlay) courtesy of Rudolf Cornelissen <rag.cornelissen@inter.nl.net>.
  * ./plugins/kde/*: configuration dialog for the KDE interface, courtesy
    of Sigmund Augdal <sigmunau@stud.ntnu.no>.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_yuy2.h: workaround for yet another annoying gcc
    behaviour with inline assembly (seems to be BeOS-specific). If anyone has
    a better idea than the huge "memory" constraint, please have a look at
    the MMX_CALL() macro!
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: corrected a bug with broken avi files.
  * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: added config_Get/PutFloatVariable to
    p_sysmbols. Thanks to Sigmund Augdal for pointing this bug out.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_pcm.c: on Win32 the aout_pcm thread is given a high
    priority. This avoids lots of audio underruns, especially when moving
    around the video window.
  * plugins/avi/avi.c : changed in order to read more avi files, Meuuh
    you can now read your file ;) (but audio is awful, perhaps because of mad
    plugin ?). Fix a bug for audio with some avi files.
  * ./plugins/satellite/satellite.c: fixed a compilation issue in satellite
    input. It now uses common or libdvbpsi ts demux. Untested cause I can't
    get our Nova Card work again.
  * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: restored vout_CopyPicture(). It is
    needed by the directx plugin damnit ;-)
  * ./include/config.h: restored AOUT_BUFFER_DURATION to its old value. It
    should solve quite a few underrun problems.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: a little bit of DirectX plugin clean-up.
  * ./ipkg/control: added more information in ipkg control file.
  * ./include/modules_inner.h: the module name is now a default shortcut, for
    it, no need to manually add it.
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c, ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: when in fullscreen
    mode, the Esc key does not quit immediately, but first escapes from
    fullscreen mode. User-requested feature.
  * ./include/os_specific.h: fixed a C++ compilation issue.
  * ./include/videolan/vlc.h: removed the main() declaration because SDL
    defines it as a macro.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: with some broken avi files, will not freeze, and
    try to detect end of file.
  * ./include/threads_func.h: moved the function definitions from threads.h
    into threads_funcs.h. This allows us to move p_main_sys into p_main
    (p_main->p_sys).
  * ./configure.in: fixed the --with-gtk-config-path and --with-sdl-config-path
    options.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: seek is faster.
  * ./configure.in: fixed a typo in libdvbpsi handling.
  * ./plugins/vcd/cdrom_tools: FreeBSD 4.5 port of the vcd input.
  * ./INSTALL.win32: updated win32 compilation instructions.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_ts.c: fixed --program option.
  * ./include/common.h: fixed vlc_memalign.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: now it can play broken files with seek enabled but
    it's very slow (will be fixed soon).
  * ./src/misc/beos_specific.c: added system_Configure(). Sorry O:-)
  * ./src/input/input_programs.c: a video divx ES will no longer be considered
    as an audio ES (thanks sam).
  * ./src/misc/darwin_specific.c: added system_Configure().
  * ./plugins/macosx/vout_macosx.c: cleaned up QTScaleMatrix().
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: A/V sync should be much more precise.
  * ./plugins/macosx/vout_qdview.c: borders in fullscreen mode are now black
    and the movie is centered.
  * ./extras/MacOSX/vlc.pbproj/project.pbxproj: new creator ID: VLC#.
  * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: exported input_ClockManageRef for fenrir.
  * ./include/video.h: moved vout_CopyPicture out of the way, an inline
    function did not make sense here.
  * ./include/video.h: moved vout_ChromaCmp out of the way.
  * ./plugins/avi/fourcc.h, ./include/video.h: merged these two files into
    video.h.
  * ./include/os_specific.h: this file is now always included.
  * ./include/debug.h: removed this file which was almost useless, and moved
    ASSERT to common.h.
  * ./include/common.h: fixed vlc_memalign and changed its prototype to
    follow posix_memalign's.
  * ./configure.in: dropped usage of $withval and $enableval in favor of the
    safer variants $with_foo and $enable_foo.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: will not segfault when no audio is found/supported.
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.c: with empty frame(data_packet) it won't segfault.
  * ./plugins/avi/avi.c: use KeyFrame to seek, so video will not be bad as
    before.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_ts.c: moved Program Specific Information
    decoder to the ts demux module.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/Makefile: added a mpeg_ts_dvbpsi module tha uses
    libdvbpsi to decode PSIs. It is used by default if the lib is found. It
    shares much code with mpeg_ts.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: fixed typo. You have to double click on
    the video window to switch to fullscreen.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: on Win32 the config file is now stored under
    the "Application Data" folder belonging to the user. (this works if at
    least IE4 is installed, otherwise the old method is used to get the
    config directory)
  * ./configure.in: fixed MacOS X module linking problem.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: we no longer segfault if argc == 0.  
  * ALL: renamed PLUGINS to __PLUGINS__ to avoid conflicts with libraries
    defining it. Grmbl.
  * ./src/input/input_ext-plugins.c: cosmetic change.
  * ./plugins/ac3_adec/*: use of _M to avoid conflict with libavcodec.a.
  * ./plugins/avi/*: a light AVI demux.
  * ./plugins/ffmpeg/*: a video decoder for divx v3 and opendivx.
  * ./plugins/win32/preferences.cpp: fixed a compilation bug
  * ./plugins/avi, ./plugins/ffmpeg: created empty directories for fenrir's
    upcoming work.
  * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: fixed the spu decoder to take the pitch
    of the destination picture into account when rendering the subtitles
    (Implemented only for the YUV modes).
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: fixed the mouse autohidding feature in
    the DirectX plugin (at least partially).
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: fixed the DirectX video output for
    non-overlay modes. It was only working in RGB16 before.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: DirectX video output plugin now uses
    triple buffering for YUV overlay. This improves the video quality a lot
    (no tearing) without affecting performance. (I knew double buffering
    sucked but I just discovered why triple buffering is better: you don't
    have to wait for the vsync to flip the buffers).
  * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c, ./plugins/dvd/dvd_es.c: temporary fix
    to avoid retrieving the spu palette from a network stream as if it was
    a DVD.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: tidied the help output code.
  * ALL: removed underscores from option names and made a few options more
    self-explanatory, for instance --input_channel becomes --audio-channel;
    run vlc -H to see what has changed.
  * ALL: replaced many occurences of "plugin" with the word "module".
  * ./src/interface/main.c: moved all satellite-specific configuration options
    to the satellite plugin.
  * ./po/*: updated translations.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_yuy2.h: optimized the 420 planar-to-packed chroma
    transformations. They're now PIC-friendly as well.
  * ./plugins/macosx/intf_open.c: added Open disc and network panels.
  * ./plugins/macosx/intf_controller.c: some changes to the control layout.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: i_warning_level is set to 0 to avoid unwanted
    verbose messages.
  * ./po/en_GB.po: British translation.
  * ./src/interface/main.c, ./src/misc/configuration.c: fixed the warning_level
    handling: "-v" and "--warning" are now working as they should and they also
    are cumulative (using -vv --warning=3 you end up with i_warning_level=5).
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: support for short options. -V, -A, -I
    are back, and we also have -4 and -6 for IPv4/IPv6.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: added config_GetFloatVariable() and
    config_PutFloatVariable() to the config module.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: added a --zoom <float> config option.
  * ./plugins/idct/idct_sparse.c: added a call to RestoreCPUState() in
    InitIDCT() so that the FPU is still available after a call to InitIDCT().
  * ./plugins/text/logger.c: deactivated stream buffering when logging to a
    file.
  * ./po/*: re-ran make update-po, fixed a few translations.
  * ./po/fr.po: completed the french translation.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.glade, ./plugins/gtk/gnome.glade: synchronized a few
    strings between the Gtk+ and GNOME modules to avoid duplicate translations.
  * ./po/de.po: updated german translation. Many thanks to Thomas Graf.
  * ./doc/vlc-howto.sgml: URL & mailing-lists corrections.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: the last category from the config options
    wasn't displayed.
  * po/nl.po: updated Netherlands translation of interface.
  * po/fr.po: completed french translations.
  * ALL: internationalized all configuration strings.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: we now set LC_CTYPE to get the right charset.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: lots of simplifications in the code.
  * ./po/vlc/pot: updated translations.

    know how to center the picture in the screen, and make the remaining space
    black instead of white, PLEASE drop me a mail!
  * ./src/input/mpeg_system.c: in TS demux, a program is selected only if a
    PMT for it was found. This should fix the problem that occured when reading
    a file directly extracted from a satellite card.
  * ./plugins/access/udp.c: UDP access plugin uses input_SetProgram.
  * ./AUTHORS: added people locations, just for fun.
  * ./configure.in: disabled SSE plugins when using mingw32.

    PowerPC platform because it was misleading.
  * ./plugins/dvdread/dvdread.c: have dvdread plug-in respond to dvd: URLs.
  * ./plugins/macosx/intf_macosx.c: MacOS X interface shouldn't take as much
    CPU as it used to.

  * ./src/interface/main.c: added options to configure antenna (sat_lnb_lof1,
    sat_lnb_lof2, sat_lnb_slof and sat_diseqc). They only appear if satellite
    input is compiled.
  * ./plugins/satellite/input_satellite.c: fixed a few bugs in satellite
    input (device was not closed in every failure case, symbol rate limits
    in gnome interface were wrong).
  * ./plugins/gtk/*: added FEC choice in command line, gtk and gnome
    interfaces. Command line is now satellite:<frequency(Hz)>,
    <polarization(0=V,1=H)>,<fec(1=1/2,2=2/3...)>,<symbol rate(kbyte/s)>
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: implemented a fix for nVidia overlays
    thanks to Bertil.
  * ./Makefile: fixed the Win32 interface under Win2k/XP.
  * ./src/misc/modules_plugins.h: implemented a dlerror()-like wrapper
    for the Win32 API.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_ps.c: fixed another bug in PS demux: the first
    program added was at the same time declared as the current program and as
    a new program, which made the ES be selected two times.
  * ./src/input/input_programs.c: fixed a bug in input_SetProgram, that made
    the ps file input launch without video.

    we may change program when reading a file.
  * ./src/input/input_programs.c: fixed a bug in input_SetProgram.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: added --input_program <int> option, to choose the
    program from the command line.

    do not accept empty macro arguments.

0.3.0
Sat,  6 Apr 2002 04:27:50 +0200

  * ./doc/release-howto.txt: updated documentation.
  * ./vlc.spec: added missing plugin filenames to the build process.
  * ./plugins/win32/mainframe.dfm: swapped two mixed up tooltips.
  * ./Makefile: fixed make dist and make distclean.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: compilation fix.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_callbacks.c: fixed ejection code.
  * ./plugins/text/ncurses.c: fixed compilation of the ncurses plugin.
  * ./vlc.spec: updated specfile.
  * ./Makefile, ./configure.in: misc BeOS build fixes.
  * ./plugins/win32/win32.cpp: fixed `--intf intfwin' which wasn't working.
  * ./Makefile: we don't include the Gtk+ and SDL DLLs in the win32 package
    anymore, the package is now 700k instead of 4MB.
  * ./configure.in, ./Makefile, ./Makefile.opts.in: replaced LIB_FOO with
    foo_LDFLAGS and CFLAGS_BAR with bar_CFLAGS for faster builds, and moved a
    lot of stuff from Makefile.opts.in back to configure.in.
  * ./install-win32: updated script for NSIS 1.96.
  * ./configure.in: added --enable-intfwin to enable the win32 interface and
    --with-bcbuilder to tell make where to find Borland C++ Builder.
  * ./plugins/win32/intfwin.bpr: we now build intfwin.so at the right place.
  * ./plugins/win32/Makefile: intfwin.so can be built using commandline.
  * ./configure.in, ./include/threads.h, ./include/common.h: a custom defs.h
    file isn't needed for the intfwin plugin anymore.
  * ./INSTALL.win32: updated compilation instructions for the intfwin plugin.
  * ./AUTHORS: added ipkiss.
  * ./plugins/win32/mainframe.cpp: disabled the "hide interface" menu
    item, not yet implemented.
  * ./plugins/win32/about.dfm: replaced the outdated author list with a
    "VideoLAN Team" entry.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.glade, plugins/gtk/gnome.glade, ./plugins/kde/kde.cpp:
    replaced the outdated author list with a "VideoLAN Team" entry.
  * ./debian/rules, ./debian/control: deactivated the vlc-kde package because
    it does not work, and removed the vlc-a52 package because liba52 is
    statically linked into vlc.
  * ./debian/control: added more helpful package descriptions.
  * ALL: changed version to 0.3.0. Yeah, it's coming.
  * ./Makefile: fixed make dist.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a vout4 image starvation bug.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: we look for libdvdcss.so.2 as well as -.so.1.
  * ./configure.in: BSD/OS fixes thanks to Steven M. Schultz.
  * ./Makefile: renamed the `snapshot' rule to `dist'.
  * ./Makefile: removed the `snapshot-nocss' rule which isn't needed anymore.
  * ./Makefile.modules: modules now depend on Makefile.opts.
  * ./configure.in: added (hopefully) explicit messages on how to get
    libdvdcss and link vlc with it.
  * ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: removed inclusion of dvd_udf.h.
  * ./plugins/win32/*: Added management for secondary config dialogs
  * ./plugins/ogg/*: added preliminary files for an Ogg/Vorbis decoder a
    contributor is currently working on.
  * ALL: removed libdvdcss from the vlc tree.
  * ALL: removed libdvdread from the vlc tree.
  * ./acconfig.h: removed this file.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dummy_dvdcss.c: merged this file into dvd.c.
  * ./AUTHORS: moved a few gentlemen to the libdvdcss AUTHORS file.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_callbacks.c: use the dvd_device config option.
  * ./po/ja.po: added Japanese translation from Fumio Nakayama
    <endymion@ca2.so-net.ne.jp>.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_callbacks.c: fixed disc ejection code.
  * ./include/threads.h: new pthread implementation for WinNT/2K/XP. This
    implementation shouldn't be subject to race conditions as it is using
    SignalObjectAndWait() from the Win32 API. As this should be somehow slower
    than the old method (still used on Win9x), you can specify that you want
    to use the old method with the "fast_pthread" config option.
  * ./include/videolan/vlc.h: added a new p_main_sys global variable. This
    variable is a pointer to an OS specific structure which is defined in
    *_specific.h. This structure can be filled by the already existing
    System_Init() function and is a nice way to avoid too many #ifdefs.
  * ./include/defs.h.in: got rid of the DVD_DEVICE macro. We now use the
    dvd_device config option. This creates a small memory leak as we don't free
    the string obtained from config_GetPszVariable, but I think we can live
    with it for now.
  * ./configure.in: the SSE plugins are disabled on the mingw32 build as they
    don't work (because memalign is not implemented on win32, and malloc only
    aligns on an 8 bytes boundary).
  * ./INSTALL.win32: fixed a small mistake.
  * ./include/config.h: fixed config directory name for windows.
  * ./plugins/win32: the network dialog now respects the preferences settings.
  * ./src/input/input_ext-plugins.c: compilation fix. :-ppppp
  * ./plugins/memcpy/fastmemcpy.h: AltiVec-enabled version of fastmemcpy.
  * ./plugins/macosx/vout_macosx.c: use ImageBuffer instead of ScreenBuffer in
    OS X video output (should be faster).
  * ./src/interface/main.c: check that channels have been created before
    the call to network_ChannelJoin.
  * ./plugins/win32/*: fixed a few bugs in the preferences.
  * ./plugins/win32/*: better auto-resizing of the main window.
  * ./plugins/win32/*: the disc dialog now respects the preferences settings.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: small compilation fix.
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: added a test for the nooverlay option.
  * ./include/config.h: changed directory of the config file for BeOS to be
    consistant with OS standard.
  * ./configure.in: BeOS, liba52 and chroma plugin compilation fixes.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_access.c: removed a warning.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: Solaris fixes by Meuuh.
  * ./FAQ: removed outdated stuff.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: fixed yet another bug related to the event
    thread creation.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: removed a few debug messages.
  * ./extras/Win32_msvc/*: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 6 project files. This
    is useful mainly for debugging as the hardware accelerated plugins can't
    be compiled with msvc.
  * ./plugins/downmix/ac3_downmix_sse.c, ./plugins/downmix/ac3_downmix_3dn.c:
    Win32 compilation fixes when downmixsse and downmix3dn are declared as
    plugins.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: fixed the waiting on the event thread
    creation in the directx plugin.
  * ./Makefile: updated the "package-win32" rule.
  * ./install-win32: all txt files are now converted to dos format (CRLF).
  * ./doc/win32/Cross-Compile-Howto.txt: VLC-Win32 Cross-Compile Howto,
    courtesy of Bill Eldridge.
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: improved overlay detection, default colour
    space selection.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: allow the user to resize the configuration
    windows.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: moved config_GetIntVariable out of the
    loop.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: you can now set a maximum height for the
    configuration windows in the gtk and gnome plugins. This patch _doesn't
    change_ the look of the interface unless this interface tries to use more
    space than allowed, in which case scrollbars are added to make the
    navigation easy. Note that this setting only affects the default size the
    interface will use, the user is then free to change the size of the window
    as he wants.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: tooltips are now triggered only in
    specific places. This is a lot less intrusive and annoying for the users.
  * ./plugins/win32: fixed the bug on exiting the vout pressing 'q'.
  * ./plugins/beos/*: implemented an "always-on-top" feature for the interface
    window, RGB16 Overlay supported again, resizing is now implemented
    consistantly.
  * ./plugins/win32: subtitles should work, now.
  * ./plugins/access/udp.c: disabled the server argument in udpstream: because
    it confuses users and is not of any practical use.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: fix for sparc.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_access.c: don't try to stat() the dvd drive letter on
    win32.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: disabled YUV overlay double buffering for
    now, as it seems to actually be slower.
  * ./include/threads.h: temporary fix in vlc_cond_signal() for win32 (I really
    should use SignalObjectAndWait() on WinNT so we can avoid race conditions
    in the pthread code). This fixes a problem noticed on WinXP where vlc would
    freeze regularly and eat-up all the CPU (fun no?).
  * ./src/input/input_programs.c: when unselecting an ES, we must ged rid of
    p_es->p_pes so that it is regererated when we select this ES again. It made
    vlc segfault when switching from some stream to another, or when switching
    program in satellite input.
  * ./plugins/access/udp.c: UDP access plug-in can now receive MPTS (Multiple
    Program TS) and switch programs.
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: audio and video output go to time-constrained
    scheduling [OS X port].
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: some dirty ifdefs for a nicer gnome
    interface (gnome buttons, gnome dialogs).
  * ./po/nl.po: translation of user interface messages to Netherlands.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c, ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c: new options "gtk_hide_toltips"
    or "gnome_hide_tooltips". Tooltips are enabled by default. This option is
    only considered on module initialization.
  * ./configure.in: GNU make detection.
  * ./extras/MacOSX/Resources/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib/objects.nib: deleted
    non-working fullscreen menu item [OS X].
  * ./plugins/access/http.c, ./plugins/access/udp.c: udp and http no longer
    modify p_input->psz_name.
  * ALL: various little portability fixes.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: changed the behaviour of the config file:
    now all the config options are saved. <string> config options which have
    no default value are also saved in the config file but as an empty string,
    and config_LoadConfigFile will ignore empty config options, which also
    means we cannot pass an empty string as a <string> config option. (this
    shouldn't matter anyway).
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: modified the gtk interface to save an
    empty <string> option as a NULL pointer.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: modified config_LoadConfigFile to consider an
    empty <string> option as a NULL pointer.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: save button (inadvertently suppressed).
  * ./plugins/win32: added toolbar icons (thanks xav), we can no longer edit
    plugin names in the preferences :)
  * ./plugins/win32: the tool button for playlist is now a toggle button.
  * ./plugins/beos/InterfaceWindow.cpp: disabled controls if the playlist was
    empty.
  * ./plugins/win32/*: added a win32 interface plugin, developed with Borland
    C++ Builder. To build the plugin, follow the instructions in
    INSTALL-win32.txt.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: fixed an ugly structure, the tabs are not
    verticaly expanded as they were, small enhancements.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c, ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c, ./plugins/gtk/gtk_common.h: new
    Tooltips structure.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: modifications of some widgets, the
    structure, cosmetic changes.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: typos, a couple of new descriptions.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: moved the "display" option from main to the
    relevant plugins. ( We now have the x11_display, xvideo_display,
    xmga_display and ggi_display options ).
  * ./INSTALL-win32.txt: fixed a little omission.
  * ./src/plugins/gtk/*: fixed a bug that made vlc segfault when choosing a
    program, change to another and come back to the first one.
  * ./src/plugins/gtk/*: added gtk and gnome interfaces for satellite input. We
    should find a way to hide the button if satellite support is not compiled.
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: implemented correct scaling and used new
    window size variables. Beta always on top for the interface window. New
    cursor handling.
  * ./plugins/macosx/aout_macosx.c: fixed a problem in the MacOS X aout which
    caused the previously played audio frames to be played when there were no
    new frames available.
  * ./plugins/macosx/vout_macosx.c: MacOS X vout now uses the height/width
    calculated in video_output.c.
  * ./configure.in: Win32 fix.
  * ./configure.in: miscellaneous fixes for the OS X port.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: the calculation for the initial video
    window dimensions is now done in video_output.c and made available into
    p_vout->i_window_height/width. This allows to get rid of duplicated code
    and unify the behaviour of the video output plugins. (not all the plugins
    have been modified because I didn't want to break anything).
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: moved GetConfigurationFromCmdLine() into
    configuration.c and renamed it to config_LoadCmdLine().
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: config_GetHomeDir doesn't use getpwuid_r
    anymore as this was creating some problems on solaris. This function now
    uses getpwuid and is called only once to store the home directory into the
    p_main structure.
  * ./plugins/satellite/*: added satellite input. It works with WinTV Nova
    card, and siemens 0.9.4 drivers from www.linuxtv.org.
  * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c: fixed stupid bug in stupid
    ConvertPrintfFormatString() function.
  * ./plugins/win32/waveout.c: fixed the "waveout not closing" bug. We need to
    reset the waveout device before closing it.
  * ./src/input/mpeg_system.c: fixed a bus error on UltraSparc.
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: Win32 and Solaris compilation fix.
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: improved scaling, correct aspect ratio even
    in full screen mode, duplicate code reduces and framework for Overlay and
    OpenGL modes in place.
  * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: kludge to allow the ALSA module to be
    compiled as a plugin. Please test.
  * ./include/modules.h: fixed a C++ warning.
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: VCD raw device fix, courtesy of Steven Schultz.
  * ./configure.in: better IPv6 detection. IPv6 is disabled under MacOS X (no
    inet_pton call).
  * ./src/input/input_programs.c: fixed some bugs in program management:
    selected ESs must be attached to the selected program.
  * ./plugins/aa: aalib output plugin courtesy of Sigmund Augdal.
  * ./configure.in: fixed a few bashisms.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: fixed build under Solaris.
  * ./TODO: updated todo list.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_access.c: fixed a memory leak.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/vpar_pool.c: fixed a memory leak.
  * plugins/win32/waveout.c: fixed typo.
  * ./configure.in: BeOS compilation fixes.
  * ./debian/rules: activated (broken) KDE interface.
  * ./plugins/access/http.c: fixed a segfault.
  * ./plugins/alsa/aout_alsa.c: fixed a segfault.
  * ./include/common.h: fixed the compilation fix for Borland C++ :)
  * ./include/common.h: compilation fix for Borland C++.
  * ./plugins/macosx/aout_macosx.c: MacOS X aout now uses AudioConverter for
    int->float.
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: Various MacOS X intf improvements and bug fixes.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb8.c: fixed a warning.
  * ./plugins/filter/deinterlace.c: fixed chroma deinterlacing.
  * ./plugins/kde/kde.cpp: the KDE interface compiles again.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_es.c: fixed a segfault I introduced today.
  * ./plugins/network/ipv4.c: cosmetic fix.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: fixed a typo in the --help output.
  * ./src/misc/netutils.c: fixed a segfault in the vlcs communication; still
    unstable but solving other bugs won't do any good without rewriting the
    whole playlist code. Which I'm doing right now.
  * ./configure.in: MacOS X compile fixes.
  * ./src/input/input.c: skip "//" if we find "://" in a resource we have to
    play : this allows us touse the syntax udpstream://host.
  * ./extras/MacOSX_dvdioctl: removed outdated files.
  * ./plugins/fx/scope.c: fixed an infinite loop error.
  * ./plugins: fixed segfaults in various demux plugins.
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: SDL_VIDEODRIVER can be specified from the
    command line; try "--vout sdl:aalib"
  * ./configure.in: fixed linking of the ipv4 plugin.
  * ./configure.in: DirectX plugin is now correctly detected and configured.
  * ./BUGS: updated bug list.
  * ./configure.in: ./configure --help should be a lot clearer now.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb8.c: plain C 8 bpp transformation.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: plain C 24/32 bpp transformations.
  * ./plugins/ggi/ggi.c: support for 8 bpp displays.
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: support for 8 bpp displays.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: support for 8 bpp displays.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a segfault.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: added an alternate fullscreen method. With this
    method, _nothing_ is allowed to be displayed on top of the video
    (especially not taskbars, etc...). Of course this can also be annoying
    sometimes, this is why it's an option.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: small fix for the config file. The parser
    assumes that the config file is divided into sections (a section is the
    config data for a plugin and begins with something like [foo]), so the
    comment for the beginning of the section must be after the section marker
    and not before.
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: tidied code and prevented curruption on
    window not containing the video. Video window now returns to correct size
    and position after toggling full screen.
  * ./configure.in: more modules are plugins.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: changed ~/.VideoLan/vlc to ~/.videolan/vlcrc,
    and a few cosmetic changes (sorry Gildas for the butchery).
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: C version of the I420 to RV15/16 chroma.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: this the last piece of the new configuration
    module. You can now save your configuration options (only from the
    gtk/gnome interface for now). The config file will be saved as
    ~/.VideoLan/vlc.
  * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: we now analyze the subtitle image
    data to find the border color and the inner colors when there was
    no way to find the palette data (network stream).
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system: fixed a parsing bug I introduced yesterday.
  * ./Makefile: fixed OS X vlc.app compilation dependencies.
  * ./configure.in: fixed the endianness check under Solaris.
  * ./src/input/input.c: strings are now initialized to "" instead of NULL.
  * ./plugins/spudec/spu_decoder.c: we now properly support the subtitle
    palette information we get from the DVD. Subtitles rox !
  * ./src/video_output/vout_subpictures.c: removed all DVD-specific routines
    and put them into spu_decoder.c.
  * ./plugins/audio_output/aout_spdif.c: removed an ugly loop.
  * ./plugins/audio_output/aout_spdif.c: moved iec958/spdif encapsulation from
    ac3_spdif to aout_spdif. It will eventually allows to use ac3_adec or a52
    for spdif output.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_access.c: fixed chapter selection at startup.
  * ./src/input/input_dec.c: p_es->p_demux_data is available in
    p_config->p_demux_data so that the input can pass information directly to
    the decoder. First application: aspect ratio for DVD is read from the ifo
    (should fix the buf with aspect ratio in anamorphic DVDs).
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_es.c: the DVD plugin also copies the spu yuv palette in
    p_demux_data so that the spudec can display subtitle with the right color
    (sam !).
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_menu.c: removed duplicate code and useless lock in gtk.
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: fixed EOF and Stop segfault in VCD input:
    input_BuffersEnd was being called twice.
  * ./AUTHORS: updated Tony Castley's e-mail.
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: new resizing and scaling code. More in line
    with BeOS standards.
  * ./plugins/a52/a52.c: a52 plugin updated to use liba52-0.7.3 (which is now
    available in debian :)
  * ./src/interface/main.c: new configuration option to choose audio output
    format at runtime. It allows to select spdif pass-through decoder with
    --ac3_adec and to remove the ugly b_ac3 in main.h. As a consequence --spdif
    doesn't work anymore: you should use --ac3_adec pass.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: return the option name in error message for
    unknown option intead of the argument.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: gtk config interface modified so you can
    only have one instance of a plugin config dialog box displayed at one time.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_preferences.c: new GTK configuration interface. This
    interface is generated dynamically at run-time from the configuration data
    contained in each plugin.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: config_PutPszVariable and config_GetPszVariable
    are now thread safe.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: few modifications/optimizations to the config
    module.
  * ./include/config.h: got rid of all the _VAR macros in config.h.
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: added missing include (MacOS X port).
  * ./plugins/dvd/*: fixed EOF segfault at end of DVD.
  * ./src/input/input.c: buffer manager is renintialised at area change.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_access.c, ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: we now exit more
    cleanly on initialization error.
  * ./plugins/dvd/*: rewrote most functions in DVD plugin. Some old bugs might
    have been solved in the operation. The plugin some be more readable now,
    and should produce fewaer segfaults (I hope so :p)
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: added some tests in open.
  * ./plugins/alsa/aout_alsa.c: spdif support in the ALSA plugin.
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: when reaching the end of a track, moves to the
    following one.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: disabled the GNOME segfault dialog in debug
    mode. We want nice, clean segfaults, with huge core files and a lot
    of rattle noise.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: I hope you liked this bug: DVD demux was always used.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_demux.c: fixed demux plugin selection.
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: take the lock on stream in VCDInit. Please
    test, as I don't have any VCD to do it.
  * ./plugins/ac3_adec/ac3_parse.c: ac3dec is now less verbose.
  * ./src/interface/interface.c: fixed a deadlock when seeking the
    stream using the keyboard arrows.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_display.c: removed an occurance of former angle item in
    gtk.
  * ./plugins/dvd/input_dvd.c, ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: fixed a bug
    in ES management introduced lately in DVD/DvdRead.
  * ./plugins/dvd/*: beginning of reorganisation in DVD plugin source files,
    in order to try to make it easier to understand. There is some work left
    though :p.
  * ./plugins/vcd/vcd.c: decreased the score for VCD plugin, as the VCD demuxer
    was used even for DVD :p. It should make autodetection work.
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: modified vcd input for the new input III. Still
    have problems with end of tracks.
  * ./plugins/vcd/vcd.c: modified the command line, as stef did for the DVD.
  * ./plugins/dvd/input_dvd.c: DVD demux was no longer selected under win32.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_summary.c, ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: DVD angle
    is now handled through a program structure, so that the interface needs
    nothing specific to change angle.
  * ./src/input/input_clock.c: fixed a bug in clock management where ES without
    a program couldn't get timestamped.
  * ./plugins/gtk/*: fixed program management in gnome/gtk. Program now also
    appears in popup.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_menu.c: in interface, only display ES associated with
    the selected program, or with no program at all.
  * ./src/input/input.c: fixed typo in the win32 change to the input parser.
  * ./plugins/dvd/input_dvd.c, ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: more complete
    command line parsing for DVD, hopefully working this time.
  * ./plugins/network/ipv6.c: IPv6 network module, courtesy of Alexis Guillard
    <alexis.guillard@bt.com>, for BT.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: --6 and --4 options to force IPv6 or IPv4 (FIXME:
    it should be -6 and -4 but I don't know how to do it with the new
    configuration module).
  * ./src/misc/netutils.c: channel manager now uses a socket from the network
    plug-in and is more portable (and probably broken, too :)
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_ps.c, ./plugins/mpeg_system/mpeg_ts.c:
    input_ReadPS and input_ReadTS are now in mpeg_system.c to be more easily
    reused by plug-ins other than mpeg_ps and mpeg_ts.
  * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c: we now make sure the aout plugin buffers
    always contain between AOUT_BUFFER_DURATION/2 and AOUT_BUFFER_DURATION*3/2
    worth of audio. This should solve the audio buffer underruns.
  * ./src/input/input.c: fix for the bug in input when filename contains a '@'
    character.
  * ./src/input/input.c: simplified the win32 specific changes to the input
    parser. (I think we can safely assume that no access plugin name will have
    a length of one character).
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: DVD access plugin is only called if specified under
    windows (no automatic detection).
  * ./plugins/dvd/input_dvd.c: replaced setenv with putenv.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_open.c: fixed a bug in gtk.
  * ./plugins/dvd/input_dvd.c: new command line for DVD, to get rid of global
    options input_title or so.
  * ./Makefile: added network to the list of the plugins directories.
  * ./plugins/dvd/input_dvd.c: fixed DVD input under Win32.
  * ./src/input/input.c: fixed input parser under win32, which couldn't
    understand that c:\windows\bureau is a valid file and doesn't need to be
    accessed with the plugin 'C' :-)
  * ./AUTHORS: added xav.
  * ./include/videolan/vlc.h: got rid of int_types.h and did a few changes
    Ipkiss will need. Hope I did not break other platforms.
  * ./include/common.h: fixed compilation problem related to ssize_t.
  * ./include/common.h: various Win32 compilation fixes.
  * ./include/input_ext-plugins.h: DVD compiles, but doesn't work yet.
  * ./plugins/network/ipv4.c: fixed some typos in my previous Win32 multicast
    commit.
  * ./plugins/dummy/input_dummy.c: fixed `vlc vlc:quit'.
  * ./src/input/input.c: initialized uninitialized variables.
  * ./src/input/input.c: initialize p_access_module & p_demux_modules to NULL
    when input thread is created.
  * ./po/no.po: Norwegian translation by Sigmund Augdal. Berd ka p tt.
  * ./src/misc/modules.c: shortcuts for --intf work again, gvlc launches the
    Gtk interface, qvlc launches the Qt interface, etc.
  * ./plugins/fx/scope.c: we now have sound together with --aout scope.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c, ./plugins/dvdread/dvdread.c: removed numerous
    deadlocks.
  * ./plugins/network/ipv4.c: multicast under Win32 now works with the new
    input.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c, ./plugins/dvdread/dvdread.c: dvd and dvdread support
    for input III.
  * ./src/input/*, ./plugins/network/*, ./plugins/access/*: Input III
    (Episode 1). Major rewrite of the buffer core functions, modularity of
    access plugins (file, udp, http), modularity of network stack (ipv4, soon
    ipv6), autodetection of the type of stream.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/vpar_headers.c: we no longer crash when the next
    stream doesn't have the same image size as the previous one.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_pcm.c: another overrun fix; please test.
  * ./configure.in: fixed a plugins/dsp.so compilation issue under OpenBSD.
  * ./plugins/dsp/aout_dsp.c: OpenBSD compilation fix.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a segfault on exit.
  * ./src/input/input.c: BeOS network support (no idea if it works when you
    don't have BONE, though).
  * ./include/common.h: BeOS compile fixes.
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: fixed BeOS video output.
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: fixed uninitialized variable in
    config_Duplicate().
  * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c: char pointers obtained by
    config_GetPszVariable need to be freed.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: forgot to add the declaration of server_port.
  * ./src/input/input.c: multicast now works under Win32, but this is a _bad_
    kludge.
  * ./include/threads.h: support for the State Threads Library, a userland
    threads library (http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/). Useless to most
    people, but can be handy to debug stuff. Activate with `--enable-st'.
  * ./plugins/ac3_spdif/ac3_spdif.c, ./plugins/dvdread/dvdread.c,
    ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: adaptation to new configuration scheme for dvd,
    dvdread and spdif.
  * ./plugins/lirc/lirc.c: removed CVS garbage.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_menu.c: fixed a compile issue on IA64.
  * ./plugins/fx/scope.c: new toy plugin, an audio scope module.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_spdif.h: replacement header for aout_common.h.

    output which made the sound stutter when wrapping around the audio output
    fifo.
  * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c: lots of simplifications in the audio
    output, got rid of b_stereo.
  * ./plugins/gtk/*: added a menu in the GTK and gnome interfaces to change
    the current program in multi-program streams (such as ones provided by a
    DVB-S card).
  * ./src/misc/configuration.c: new configuration architecture for vlc.
  * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c: fixed array over-run bug in intf_MsgUnsub.
  * ./configure.in: don't try to grok altivec with mingw32.
  * ./configure.in: --with-directx-path should now indicate the path where the
    actual headers are (before the headers had to be in an include subdir). By
    the way you can download these header files from the videolan web site.
  * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: if symbol foo isn't found in the
    plugin, we always try to open _foo, whatever the architecture.
  * ./plugins/lirc/lirc.c: non-blocking patch from Sigmund Augdal
    <sigmunau@stud.ntnu.no>; hope this time my enhancements don't break
    everything :-)
  * ./configure.in: gtk*-config detection fix for FreeBSD.
  * ./configure.in: removed a bashism.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: support for systems without shm.h.
  * ALL: QNX compilation fixes here and there; the qnx plugin still doesn't
    work.
  * ./Makefile: the win32 port now uses a more recent version of gtk+.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c: the log window is now black with colourful text.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gnome.c: ported the log window to the GNOME interface.
  * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c: messages are sent to the queue even if
    -vvvv* wasn't specified.

  * ./plugins/text/logger.c: rewrote an ugly loop.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk.c: added a Gtk+ window containing all the log
    messages; updated in real time. To open it, go to "view"->"messages".
  * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c: got rid of TRACE and intf_DbgMsg which were
    seldom used anyway.
  * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c: all intf_*Msg functions now write to stderr.
  * ./src/interface/intf_msg.c: implemented a message queue interface plugins
    can subscribe to.
  * ./plugins/text/logger.c: wrote the logger interface plugin. Usage:
    vlc -I logger:filename.log.
  * ./src/video_output/vout_subpictures.c: lots of fixes in the SPU renderer.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a typo in aspect ratio
    calculation.
  * ./plugins/macosx/vout_macosx.c: MacOS X vout improvements.

    terminate properly.
  * ./Makefile: added a new make target: package-macosx.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_playlist.c: Win32 compilation fixes (mingw includes
    dirent).
  * ./configure.in: configure now checks for ddraw.h and not directx.h.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: don't include directx.h anymore (this
    file isn't part of the directx sdk).
  * ./plugins/waveout/waveout.c: moved all the stuff from aout_waveout.c
    directly into waveout.c (I don't know what I was thinking about when I
    created these two files ;-)
  * ./plugins/waveout/waveout.c: until we fix the audio buffer underrun
    problem, waveout will be the default audio output on win32 (instead of
    directx).
  * ALL: got rid of *_Probe functions because most of them were duplicates
    of the real _Init or _Create functions. That's 1000 lines of code gained.
  * ./src/misc/modules.c: we try not to keep the global lock in module_Need,
    which should speed up output spawning.
  * ./plugins/dummy/input_dummy.c: fixed vlc:quit command.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_playlist.c: compilation fix.
  * ./plugins/macosx/*: preliminary fixes for the vout4 port.
  * ./plugins/gtk/*: Win32 fixes.
  * ./plugins/beos/*: BeOS fixes from Rudolf Cornelissen.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: --desync now really accepts a value in ms.
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: fixed a crash when not opening a VCD.
  * ./src/video_output/vout_subpictures.c: fixed subtitles under BeOS and
    other architectures which don't support overlay.
  * ./plugins/a52/a52.c: compilation fix (include stdint.h).
  * ./plugins/a52/a52.c: fixed a SEGV.
  * ./plugins/beos/vout_beos.cpp: ported the BeOS RGB video output to
    vout4. The overlay video output still needs to be written though.
  * ./plugins/a52/*: just renamed the liba52_adec plugin into a52 to comply
    with the naming convention used by the other plugins.
  * ./plugins/lirc/lirc.c: IR remote control plugin by Sigmund Augdal
    <sigmunau@stud.ntnu.no>, activate with --enable-lirc.
  * ./configure.in: put liba52_adec in a builtin for PIC/non-PIC reasons.
  * ./plugins/liba52_adec/*: new AC3 decoder plugin using liba52 from Aaron
    Holtzman and Michel Lespinasse.  This plugin isn't used by default, you
    have to specify: --ac3_adec liba52.
  * ./src/misc/modules.c: changed module_Need to make it possible to
    have several modules with the same shortcut name.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_open.c: fixed a bug in the network dialog.
  * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: added mstrtime() to module_symbols_t so we
    can compile the mpeg_vdec plugin with TRACE mode enabled.
  * ./plugins/ac3_spdif/ac3_spdif.c: fixed ac3_spdif which has been broken
    recently.
  * ./plugins/ac3_adec/ac3_adec.c: check frequency in ac3_adec and change fifo
    if needed.
  * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c: moved initialisation of p_aout from
    plugins to audio_output.c; if audio output rate is specified at launch
    time, we try to use it by default.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: MMX YUV to RGB transformation for 15bpp.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: added double-buffering for the directx
    plugin in overlay mode.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: several directx bug-fixes: implemented
    the right behaviour on exit, fixed bug preventing the creation of several
    windows  (the wall filter is working now :-)), fixed unnecessary background
    redraws (it made the video flicker), fixed bug where we were losing the
    video display because of lost surfaces in video memory, when using hardware
    overlay, the output window will now specify "(using hardware overlay)".
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: we don't use DPMS functions if they are
    not available.
  * ./plugins/win32/waveout.c: added a new very simple audio plugin for
    Win32. This plugin uses the waveOut API which is a lot easier to use for
    streaming stuff than directsound. (you don't have to take care of
    underflows anymore because it doesn't use circular buffers). If you are
    having a lot of underflows, this plugin is currently better adapted than
    the directx plugin.
  * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c: moved some initialization stuff in
    audio_out.c so we can know the caracteristics of the audio stream before
    calling aout_Open().
  * ./configure.in, Makefile: configure and Makefile tweaking for dvdread
    module.
  * ./src/misc/modules_plugin.h: fixed a missing function initialization
    which made decoder plugins segfault in GetChunk calls.
  * ./configure.in: proper soundcard.h check from Yves Duret.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_adec/mpeg_adec.c: enabled --stereo option for streams that
    pretend to be mono while they are not.
  * ./plugins/ac3_adec/ac3_adec.c: fixed an alignment issue in the ac3 decoder.
  * ./src/input/input_dec.c: decoders do not necessarily use bit stream (see
    mad plug-in).
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_adec.c: mad PTS should finally be accurate.
  * ./configure.in: some configure changes.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_adec.c: libmad_input now takes one frame at a time (see
    mad_adec.h for defines)
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_libmad.c: audio_linear_dither() gives better sound
    quality then s24_to_s16_pcm(), but also makes audio artefacts louder so
    disabled it for now.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_libmad.c: cleaned up libmad_output.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_adec.c: cleaned up InitThread.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_adec.h: made buffer size match libmad's expectations.
  * ./plugins/mad/DESIGN: updated documentation.
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_events.c: fixed crashes on exit in the directx
    plugin.
  * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: vout_PlacePicture is now accepting
    picture width=height=0.
  * ./configure.in: added extra checks for strange compilers such as
    Borland C++ which do not support all gcc options. Note that vlc does
    not compile with bcc32 yet, but is getting closer and closer to.
  * ./plugins/win32: skeleton for the win32 interface Ipkiss is developing.
  * ./config.guess ./config.sub: latest GNU versions.
  * ./configure.in: when possible, xvideo is compiled as a plugin.
  * ./vlc.spec: fixed a few minor inaccuracies.
  * ./debian/control: vlc-gui is no longer depended on, but rather recommended.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: --spumargin flag; use this to force displaying
    subtitles at the bottom of the screen instead of putting them in the
    middle, for instance: `--spumargin 5'.
  * ./plugins/qnx/qnx.c, ./plugins/macosx/macosx.c, ./plugins/beos/beos.cpp:
    converted the plugin initialization code of the macosx, beos and qnx
    code. (please note that they should still not compile as they need
    to be adapted to the new Vout4 architecture)
  * ./plugins/directx/vout_directx.c: major rewrite of the directx video
    plugin to adapt it to the new vout4 architecture. This plugin has also
    been through a major clean-up and it is now much more robust and optimized.
  * ./plugins/gtk/gtk_playlist.c: fixed a few problems with the win32 build.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: replaced the "overlay" command line option with
    "nooverlay". The former was confusing and useless because overlays were
    used by default anyway.
  * ./vlc.spec: imported MandrakeSoft's new spec file.
  * ./debian/control: fixed build-dependencies for vlc-mad.
  * ./debian/rules: fixed the vlc-arts and vlc-mad package builds.
  * ./plugins/gtk/{gtk|gnome}.c: the gnome/gtk interface should no longer use
    p_input->stream before it has been initialized.
  * ./src/input/input.c: stream lock is initialized in input_CreateThread
    instead of initThread, to have it initialized when we call it in the
    interface.
  * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c: added support for S8 and U16 aout.
  * ./debian/control: fixed Debian build-depends.
  * ./include/config.h: changed RELEASE to HAVE_RELEASE because RELEASE
    is already defined in <scsi/scsi.h> under Linux.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_adec.c: fixed issues in the PTS handling of the mad
    plug-in (incomplete).
  * ./src/input/input_ext-dec.c: more precise way to retrieve a PTS from the
    bit stream.
  * ./INSTALL.libmad: configure, build and install instructions for libmad
    library and mad plugin.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_adec.c: smooth sound (not tested on iPaq).
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_common.c: le coup de grce: all the code in audio
    output is now factorized (except for ac3 spdif) in aout_common.c/.h.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_common.h: aout thread functions are declared with
    a macro.
  * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c: HUGE cleanings in audio output: removed
    AOUT_INTF_*_FIFO, which where not used.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_common.c: factored S16StereoPlay, U8MonoPlay, and
    so on.., in a single function aout_FillBuffer (unsigned 8bit may be broken,
    but I have no stream to test with :(
  * ./configure.in: a few fixes for the Win32 build.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed all the problems related to
    ToggleFullScreen().
  * ./src/misc/modules.c: fixed a compile issue under platforms without
    HAVE_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS.
  * ./src/interface/intf_eject.c: MacOS X port.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb16.c: 24/32 bpp software YUV.
  * ./plugins/ggi/ggi.c: activated double buffering.
  * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: we create more Xv pictures to
    get smoother rendering.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_libmad.c: removed aout_CreateFifo from mad_adec.c
    InitThread() and added it to mad_libmad.c.
  * ./src/interface/intf_eject.c: BSD compilation fix suggested by Steven M.
    Schultz.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_s16.c: beginning of code factorization in
    aout_s16 (more cleaning will come). As for libmad, I have tried to create
    the aout fifo in libmad_output, to open it with the right sample rate, but
    strangely it didn't work.
  * ./src/input/input.c: fixed a few segfaults caused by the dummy plugin.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_adec/mpeg_adec.c: fixed a segfault due to misuse of
    DecoderError.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: replaced XFlush with XSync. This must be the
    fourth time someone has to commit this, so I added a reminder :-)
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/input_ts.c: hopefully fixed a bug in TS input, that
    caused a segfault when there was no network stream.
  * ./src/interface/intf_eject.c: BSD/OS port by Steven M. Schultz.
  * ./include/modules_inner.h: replaced _X with __VLC_SYMBOL because _X was
    already a system macro under MacOS X.
  * ./plugins/dummy/dummy.c: fixed vlc:loop, vlc:quit, etc. entries.
  * ./plugins/glide/glide.c: activated double buffering.
  * ./plugins/mga/xmga.c: started writing an xmga plugin; doesn't work yet.
  * ./src/input/input.c: fixed the input memory leak, and the insane thread
    spawning we got with vlc:loop.
  * ./src/misc/intf_eject.c: disc ejection routine courtesy of Julien Blache,
    currently Linux-only.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_ext-dec.c: better communication between audio
    decoder and output: aout plugins are now opened directly in the right
    mode (works with mpeg_adec and ac3_adec, not tested with mad).
  * ./src/audio_output/audio_output.c: first attempt to implement mono output
    (doesn't work yet).
  * ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: DVDRead plugins works again more or
    less ; major bugs remain but it is usable. It is selected by default if
    you have it compiled.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/vpar_headers.c: fixed a bug in QuantMatrixExtension,
    many thanks to "Thomas L. Wood" <twood@lucent.com> !
  * ./debian/control: updated list of supported architectures.
  * ./share/*: added 16x16 and 32x32 versions of PNG icons.
  * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: removed the mgammx module and put the code in
    the chroma_i420_ymga module instead. This introduces a slight
    performance issue as we now need to memcpy() the Y plane, but I have
    some vout4 enhancements on their way which make this point moot.
  * ./debian/changelog: imported official Debian changelog.
  * ./debian/control: activated the vlc-mad and vlc-arts packages; package
    builds should now work again.
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd.c: solved a symbol resolution issue when vlc was
    compiled without libdvdcss which overflowed the return stack.
  * ./plugins/ggi/ggi.c: ported the GGI plugin to vout4.
  * ./plugins/glide/glide.c: ported the Glide plugin to vout4 (untested).
  * ./src/input/input.c: prepared everything for multi-input mode; since
    no interface is yet prepared to handle this, I changed them so that
    they just use the first available input for now. This may break other
    things, but I promise I'll eventually repair everything :-)
  * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: pipeline and cache optimizations.
  * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: MMX-accelerated version of the MGA plugin.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_vdec/Makefile: little workaround for PA-Risc compilation.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_libmad.c: optimized libmad_output() for smoother sound.
    It is still not optimal.
  * ./plugins/fb/fb.c: ported the framebuffer video output to vout4.
  * ./src/audio_output/aout_s16.c: fixed a segfault. It may have unexpected
    side effects because I don't know this part of the code, but at least
    it doesn't crash anymore.
  * ./plugins/beos/beos.cpp: first attempt at porting the BeOS plugin to the
    new video output and module systems. Doesn't work nor even compile yet.
  * ./configure.in: we now check the gtk-config version.
  * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: we use the MGA_VID_FSEL ioctl to select the
    frame to be displayed. Unfortunately, increasing the number of
    frames doesn't seem to work and makes the picture stutter...
  * ./Makefile: fixed a bug when no builtins were selected.
  * ./plugins/mga/mga.c: ported the MGA video output to vout4. Only does YV12
    for the moment, and there is a strange bug with some streams which gives
    only a green image. Needs to be looked at.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed a few typos.
  * ./plugins/mad/DESIGN: updated documentation.
  * ./plugins/mad/TODO: updated TODO list.
  * ./plugins/mad/BUGS: updated documentation.
  * ./plugins/mad/mad_libmad.h: removed unused prototype from headerfile.
  * ./configure.in: fix for obscure architectures like hppa where target_os
    isn't properly detected.
  * ./include/video_output.h: got rid of pf_setpalette; I'll find a nicer way.
  * ./plugins/mga.c: fixed MGA module compilation. Doesn't work yet, though.
  * ./include/common.h: hton64 is now an inline function.
  * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c et al.: vout4 now automatically
    detects when two chroma formats are the same, such as UYVY/Y422, or
    roughly equivalent, such as I420/YV12. Plugins need not worry about
    conversion anymore.
  * ./BUGS: added a list of known bugs. Please add your findings!
  * ./MODULES: added a short description of each module. Maybe we should
    add more details to make this file really useful.
  * ./doc/bugreport-howto.txt: wishful thinking...
  * ./Makefile: added a workaround for the fact that .c files don't depend
    on <videolan/vlc.h>.
  * ./plugins/memcpy/memcpy.c: all memcpy modules are now built from the same
    single file.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: added the --nommx, --no3dnow, --nommxext, --nosse
    and --noaltivec options to vlc.
  * ./configure.in: removed the --disable-mmx option, now useless because
    of the vlc --no* options.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: fixed a crash caused by the memcpy module
    being released too early.
  * ./include/video.h: more vout4 changes, including margin support, more
    FOURCC formats recognized, transparent support of identical or almost
    identical FOURCC formats.
  * ./include/video_output.h: added a vout_Render function to video output
    modules which is to be executed before vout_Display.
  * ./include/common.h: this header is back.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_rgb.c: planar YUV 4:2:0 to packed RGB conversion
    functions, mostly taken from vout3's yuv functions, but heavily modified
    to use FAST_MEMCPY and to handle image dimensions which are not multiples
    of 16. Not all functions have been written yet, though.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i420_yuy2.c: planar YUV 4:2:0 to packed YUV conversion
    functions, various targets such as 4:2:2 YUYV, YVYU, UYVY, or 2:1:1 YUYV,
    with accelerated MMX versions.
  * ./plugins/chroma/i422_yuy2.c: same as i420_yuy2.c but takes planar YUV
    4:2:2 pictures in input. With accelerated MMX versions as well. This plugin
    makes it possible to display 4:2:2 files on most video cards without the
    quality loss of 4:2:0 downsampling.
  * ./plugins/filter/*: thanks to the vout_Render function, all filters now
    output their data perfectly in sync.
  * ./plugins/dvdread/Makefile: fix to prevent unnecessary target rebuilds.
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: support for YV12, UYVY, YUY2 and YVYU overlays.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: support for I420, YV12, YUY2 and Y211 overlays.
  * ./ChangeLog: imported the 0.2.92 changes, unrolled current CVS changes.
  * ./include/config.h et al.: this file is no longer generated.
  * ./include/video.h: we use the FOURCC definition of a chroma format to
    describe picture types (see http://www.webartz.com/fourcc/).
  * ./plugins/dvdread/input_dvdread.c: compilation fix by Eyal Lebedinsky.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed the XShm operations order.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: small optimizations.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: removed unused code.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: your old window position and size are now restored
    when you come out of fullscreen mode.
  * ./plugins/esd/esd.c: fixed detection of the esd plugin.
  * ./plugins/mpeg_system/input_ts.c: fixed the ts plugin's input type
    detection.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed the BadCursor error in the x11 and xvideo
    plugins. For real this time (unlike my 2001/08/03 fix :p).
  * ./plugins/filter/wall.c: made the wall filter work a bit better. It now
    spawns a 3x2 mosaic, but this will eventually be configurable,  la
    `--filter wall:3x3'.
  * ./plugins/arts/arts.c: fixed the aRts audio output plugin.
  * ./configure.in: removed duplicate function checks.
  * ./Makefile.modules: added extra magic so that the module Makefiles are now
    ridiculously simple. And I mean *simple*. Check it! This will make a
    possible switch to full autoconf/automake a lot easier.
  * ./include/modules_inner.h: added the vlc version name to the plugin
    symbols, to be sure we only load plugins with the same version number. A
    nasty consequence is that you need to rebuild your tree after midnight if
    you are using a CVS tree :-)
  * ./include/modules_export.h: got rid of modules_export.h by #defining
    exported functions in the same header as their prototype.
  * ./include/videolan/vlc.h: added modules_inner.h and other commonly used .h
    files to common.h so there are less and less files to include, and renamed
    common.h to <videolan/vlc.h>.
  * ./src/misc/tests.c: first modifications to the module handling system
    towards my ultimate goal to get rid of the *_Probe functions. Got rid of
    TestMethod and TestCPU, as well as src/misc/tests.c.
  * ./plugins/chroma/yv12_rgb8.c, ./plugins/chroma/yv12_rgb16.c: wrote the
    chroma plugin handling functions. No YUV functions have been ported yet
    because it'ls a lot of work, but the core system works, I tried it with a
    naive yv12->rgb16 plugin (which will disappear when the real functions are
    ready).
  * ./plugins/dvd/dvd_summary.c: made a lot of functions one-liners to avoid
    wasting too many output lines.
  * ./plugins/dvd/input_dvd.c: fixed a segfault in DVDInit.
  * ./plugins/gtk/fixfiles.sh: Added a fixfiles.sh script to be run after Glade
    has generated its C files.
  * ./plugins/kde/*: did some work on the KDE interface to make it suck a bit
    less. It still segfaults, but at least it runs and it looks less ugly.
  * ./plugins/sdl/vout_sdl.c: RGB SDL rendering works again, though in 16bpp
    only.
  * ./plugins/vcd/linux_cdrom_tools.c: made this file independent of any vlc
    structure so that it'll be easily put in a library. Maybe libdvdcss?
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: fixed VCD date display.
  * ./plugins/x11/*: merged vout_xvideo.c, vout_x11.c and vout_common.c into
    xcommon.c.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: wrote non-Shm XVideo output.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: made X11 output work again. Still pretty unstable,
    only works for 16bpp.
  * ./po/fr.po: additional french translation. Any taker for the rest?
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed a segfault when the allocated
    pictures were not direct buffers.
  * ./share/*: replaced 48x48 .xpm images with 32x32 ones to conform to Debian
    policy (Closes Debian bug #126939).
  * ./Makefile: removed the automatic ./configure launch when running
    `make all' for the first time.
  * ./plugins/filter/distort.c: --filter distort:ripple (Ok, ok, I promise it's
    the last one !! :-)
  * ./configure.in: fixed compilation with dvdcss disabled.
  * ./configure.in: fixed compilation with plugins disabled.
  * ./plugins/dvd/input_dvd.c, ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: removed useless
    variables in the VCD and DVD plugins.
  * ./plugins/vcd/input_vcd.c: fixed a function which was returning
    "struct foo" in the VCD plugin.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: fixed the old  XVideo eats more and more CPU 
    bug I mistakenly reintroduced in my first vout4 commit.
  * ./src/misc/modules: we now stop at the first ':' when looking for a module
    name, to easily pass information to the modules. Possible example:
    --vout sdl:software, implementation of such an option is left as an
    exercise.
  * ./plugins/filter/filter.c: merged filter_bob and filter_bob422 into
    filter_bob. Use --filter bob to deinterlace 422 into 420 as well.
  * ALL: factorized code common to most filters and the video output, optimized
    a few filters by aligning data and reading 64 bits at a time.
  * ./plugins/filter/transform.c, ./plugins/filter/distort.c: two new
    absolutely useless, CPU-eating, resource-wasting, but fun filters: enjoy
    `transform', which performs flips and 90 rotations, and `distort', which
    performs animated image effects (currently only a naive sine wave is
    implemented). Usage examples: --filter transform:hflip,
    --filter transform:vflip, --filter transform:90, --filter transform:180,
    --filter transform:270, --filter distort:wave.
  * ./plugins/x11/xcommon.c: added missing XSync() in the XVideo plugin.
  * ./plugins/filter/deinterlace.c: pathetic attempt at a 4:2:2 renderer and
    deinterlacer, combining the most awful line dropping techniques of both BOB
    and 422 to 420 downscaling. Don't worry, it should only survive for a
    couple of days.
  * ./plugins/filter/wall.c: new stupid plugin: "--filter wall" for split-image
    playback :-) (will evolve into a real image wall plugin when I have time)
  * ./plugins/filter/bob.c, ./plugins/filter/invert.c: filter plugins. Not very
    polished (please don't look at how the dates are calculated!), but worth a
    try. Use the following flags: "--filter invert" for inverse video,
    "--filter bob" for BOB deinterlacing
  * ./src/video_output/vout_pictures.c: buffer choice optimizations - vout4
    should eat even less CPU now.
  * ./src/video_output/video_output.c: fixed aspect ratio handling.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: additional fixes for OSes with no gettext (thanks
    to ej0).
  * ./configure.in: don't try to use gettext if we don't have GNU gettext. This
    may change in the future though (most GNU software seems to include a local
    copy of gettext in case the operating system doesn't provide it).
  * ./debian/rules, ./debian/control: added vlc-arts to the debian package
    generation.
  * ./po/ru.po: (very old) russian translation courtesy of Valek Filippov
    <frob@df.ru>.
  * ./po/fr.po: fixed a charset issue in the french translation.
  * ./config.guess, ./config.sub: updated these files from GNU's latest
    versions.
  * ./po/vlc.pot: added vlc.pot skeleton for translators.
  * ./src/interface/intf_channels.c, ./include/keystrokes.h: removed unused
    files.
  * ./include/common.h: put common_win32.h back into common.h -- it wasn't that
    big and we should not multiply header files.
  * ./src/interface/main.c: added gettext support by Thomas Graf
    <reeler@reeler.org>, may be broken on other platforms but we'll only see
    it when I'm finished with vout 4 :-)
  * ./src/video_output/*: new video output version 4, featuring direct to YUV
    buffer decoding, non-ugly subtitle blending, XVideo and SDL video output.
  * ./plugins/spudec/*: renamed spu_dec to spudec and mad_adec to mad to stay
    coherent with other plugins. Also, renamed mpeg to mpeg_system.

    when there was no valid sequence.
  * Hopeless fix for the input netlist corruption bug.
  * Implemented simple BDirectWindow (DMA) support.
  * DeleteDecoderConfig wasn't freeing (anymore) the packets left in the
    decoder fifo. This bug was creating an io_vec starving on title change

  * Added bytes_swap.h to provide ntoh() and htol() on Win32. With this
    change we don't have to link winsock2 with every plugin anymore. This
    should also give us a slight speed increase.
  * Added #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN in threads.h to speed-up compilation
    on Win32.
  * Modified ac_downmix_3dn and sse so they compile with the latest gcc for

  * Activated old crappy subtitle rendering in overlay mode (ugly but
    probably better than having no subtitles at all).
  * Added proper Conflicts: rules in debian/control.
  * configure.in fixes for BSD/OS.
  * Added vlc:loop playlist command to go back at the beginning.
    Usage: vlc file1.mpeg file2.mpeg ... fileN.mpeg vlc:loop

  * Removed the "make all" kludge in the Makefile.opts rule. I hope this
    patch is harmless on all systems.
  * Added a dummy libdvdcss so that the DVD plugin can be used without
    libdvdcss. It will try to dlopen() libdvdcss at runtime, though,
    and will use the dummy functions only if it couldn't find a valid

    responsiveness of vlc.
  * Modified input_dvd so you can now go directly to the selected chapter
    when you change the title.
  * Implemented the Probe function in the Xvideo plugin. Xvideo is now the
    default video output plugin when it is supported.

    interruption.
  * Plugins are now compiled in plugins/* and libraries in lib/*.
  * The KDE UI compiles again but does not work yet.
  * ALSA plugin message corrections.

    and stderr to the specified file. This option should mainly be useful
    on Win32.
  * On Win32, vlc now has an icon associated to the .exe file, and is a full
    GUI application (you don't have this annoying dos command box anymore)
  * Added INSTALL-win32.txt for specific details to the Win32 port.
  * Compile fix for newer versions of MacOS X by Colin Simmonds
    <colin_simmonds@Mac.lover.org>.
  * Win32 network support by Boris Dors <babal@via.ecp.fr>.

    threads API to GNU Pth. Activate with --enable-pth. It doesn't seem to
    spawn new threads for me, maybe someone will have better luck.
  * Makefile optimizations.
  * Automatic build of libdvdcss if not found.
  * The DVD netlist no longer stops when the fifo is empty ; it just waits
    until there are free vectors again.
  * Exported the CSS part of the dvd plugin into a library. See
    ChangeLog.libdvdcss for a separate changelog.
  * Slight modification in input_dvd since Getiovec wasn't at the right place.
  * Send escape packet when changing title, not to be stuck in some decoder.
  * The position in the title is now reset when we change title to
    prevent a title from being unavailable because we're stuck at the end.
  * Fixed a bug with 1-chapter-long titles that displayed chapter 0.
  * Added a _temporary_ field in p_main to know whether the audio stream is
    AC3 (ugly). It allows a vlc launched in spdif mode to play mpeg or lpcm
    audio.
  * Cleaned the title property messages to get rid of the ugly stars.
  * Added LPCM support. It should work with stereo LPCM.
  * Fixed a warning when compiling main.c.
  * Checked that OS supports SSE instructions on PIIIs (to avoid illegal
    hardware instructions on Linux 2.2.x).
  * Fixed a bug in synchro reinitialization: we no longer have a shift each
    time we restart the synchro (for SCR discontinuity for instance)
  * In DVD mode, we reinit the synchro only if the SCR are not continuous
    (instead of each cell).
  * Tried to improve AC3 spdif to prevent desynchronization.
  * Lots of DirectX plugin fixes by Gildas Bazin.
  * Compilation fix in message queue mode.
  * Another FreeBSD compilation fix.
  * SDL compilation fix for FreeBSD.
  * Fixed compilation of motion modules as plugins.
  * Applied old FreeBSD patch for dvd input by German Tischler.
  * Found what was causing the slowdowns: a namespace collision. Put all
    plugins into builtins again.
  * Put most builtins in plugins again due to performances issues.
  * Fixed the painfully slow build process (at last!).
  * Added new dummy input plugin.

    the patches to the Gtk+ interface.
  * Fixed a segfault in the SPU decoder initialization.

    linux-kernel like author list.
  * Updated TODO list.
  * Fixed a segfault in the BeOS interface when --noaudio was specified.
  * Title and Chapter selection in the Gnome and Gtk+ interfaces.
  * Fixed a bug in audio selection
  * Tried to fix an issue in size computing.
  * Commited BeOS changes by Richard Shepherd and Tony Castley.
  * Added boolean_t b_YCbr to vout_thread_s structure to flag YUV-YCbCr
    decoding needed instead of YUV-RGB
  * Will be removed later when video_output.c rewritten
  * vout_CreateThread() initialises b_YCbr to zero
  * New BeOS video plugin that supports hardware overlays and new
    MediaPlayer compatible interface
  * Added YUV-YCbCr transforms
  * Fixed bugs in title/chapter handling once more, especially for size
    detection and location of main movie.
  * Support for multitrack DVD : now the stream is given to input as it has
    to be ; however, all the tracks are displayed one after the other ; I
    think we need to decode navigation ES to choose the track
  * Fixed behaviour at end of device.
  * Added DVD/VCD button and menu for quick DVD device selection to the
    Gnome and Gtk+ interfaces, so that vlc can play a DVD even when
    launched from a GUI.
  * Added debian/* files to help generating CSS-enabled non-US packages,
    and changed plugins/dvd/* to reflect this change.
  * Added .xpm icons (fixes lintian warnings).
  * --help output and manpage are now in sync (Closes Debian bug #87478).
  * Fixed Build-dpends entry in debian/control (Closes Debian bug #83707).
  * Completely changed title and chapter initialization. Now we have real
    title units.
  * Fixed size for a majority of DVD.
  * More consistency in the p_input->stream management.

    for me to build the Debian CSS-free packages.
  * Fixed miscellaneous alignment problems (alpha/sparc ports) ;
  * Added a fps display when toggling 'i' ;
  * Fixed a bug in the video parser where one picture buffer was not
    released at quit time ;
  * Broke the mux_rate calculation, but hey guys ! it was already broken and
    nobody noticed it.
  * New function for DVD reading, that is able to read multiple blocks
    (I've chosen 32 now), that doesn't use any memcpy anymore and is also much
    faster. It is ready now for cell positioning in multi-angle DVD (to come
    soon).
  * DVD specific netlist adapted to 2048 bytes long blocks that contain
    several data_packets.
  * Modification in mpeg_system.c to use p_payload_start instead of
    p_buffer (necessary for DVD plugin). It does not break other plugins
    since they set p_payload_start to p_buffer
  * New field i_read_once in input_thread_s to be able to read more than
    the TS related 7 packets ; i_read_once is set to INPUT_READ_ONCE by
    defaults but plugins can change it during initialisation.
  * Bug fix with frequential downmix
  * Additional optimizations to the subtitle decoder
  * The GGI video output should now be faster. Also, right-mouse-clicking
    works in GGI mode as well.

    decoding time, not rendering time. The main loop in vout_RenderSPU
    is now 20 lines long.
  * The Gtk+ interface is now built as a Debian package as well. The Gnome
    package depends on it because of the icon and menu entry.
  * Added an intf_WarnHexDump() function to do raw hexadecimal dumps of
    memory areas. For debugging purposes or for real men, as you wish.
  * Lots of tidying in dvd_ioctl.c, a few comments added.
  * Better error handling in the subpicture decoder.
  * Tidied video_spu.c. More to come later.
  * Fixed subtitle displaying. Will soon work in overlay mode as well.
  * Disabled slice-level resynchro since it's probably buggy.
  * Fixed a structural major bug in the macroblock structure management.
  * Added debug messages.
  * Fixed a compile problem in debug mode.
  * Added functions and hooks to display dates instead of off_t.
  * Added a 'd' keystroke to dump the stream contents (for debugging
    purposes).
  * New ES detection based on .ifo for DVD module. It might fail (I have
    found one DVD for which ifo seems false).
  * Title and chapter selection on the command line (see -t and -T options)
    It will allow to watch some DVD that went through menus by default.
  * Beginning of menus in gnome interface.
  * Fix bug in ac3dec for mono streams
  * BeOS: new video output method, the vlc now uses BBitmap instead of
    BDirectWindow (better performances)
  * BeOS: added resizing
  * BeOS: added beta support for overlay
  * Added a plain Gtk+ port of the Gnome interface, for the gnome-impaired
    people. Gtk+ is now compiled by default, while Gnome isn't (you will
    have to add --enable-gnome when running configure)
  * Replaced -lcurses with -lncurses in configure.in.
  * Added DemuxPSI, DecodePAT and DecodePMT. Never tested which streams
    where PAT or PMT are splitted in more than one section.

0.2.62
Fri,  2 Mar 2001 17:32:24 +0100

  * DVD plugin is still non-functional when you don't have DVD ioctls,
    but at least it compiles under BeOS as well.
  * Minor cosmetic changes here and there.

    a given file.
  * Fixed a deadlock in the Gnome interface. Next time I'll initialize
    my mutexes, I promise.
  * Added Oct to the authors list in intf_gnome.glade :)
  * Second step in area management ; everything is in place now to have
    title handling; it is coming :)
  * Ported Glide and MGA plugins to the new module API. MGA never worked,
    so this didn't make it work better.
  * Started thinking about built-in modules, and added some code to
    make it easier eventually.
  * Added Oct in the AUTHORS file.
  * Fixed a mistake in configure.in.
  * All your base are belong to us.

    when launched from the Tracker.
  * Fixed a similar bug in src/video_output/video_text.c.
  * BeOS CSS support, thanks to Markus Kuespert <ltlBeBoy@beosmail.com>
    who ported the Linux DVD ioctls. We can now read encrypted DVDs
    under BeOS ! Woohoo.
  * First serie of changes in DVD module for the forthcoming interface menus.
    There is a new capability in input type modules for setting the
    attributes of a new area. It is set to NULL for PS and TS plugins.
    It should be called for every title change, chapter change,
    audio mode change or spu channel change.
  * Kludge of the kludge, removing an oddity in YUV initialisation, and
    activating YUV overlay on startup whenever hardware acceleration is
    available. Thanks for bearing with us, stay tuned.
  * mux_rate parsing.
  * Changed video decoder's error messages into warnings.
  * Add dither fix
  * Drag and drop support under BeOS.
  * Change in the code to detect beginning of movie. It is much better now
    but still fails with some DVD for which the movie is not the first
    Program.
  * Beginning of ideas to handle chapters and ES selection
  * configure.in and Makefile.in patches for better SDL support and
    support for $(bindir) $(datadir) and $(libdir) stuff, courtesy
    of Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <misiek@pld.ORG.PL>
  * Ported ggi.so to the new modules API. As for the other modules, only
    the "q" key works. Moreover, VLC doesn't exit cleanly if you close the
    GGI window.
  * Deactivated non-working widgets in the Gnome interface.
  * Added CONTRIBUTORS file.
  * Ported the framebuffer plugin to the new module API. As for most of the
    other video output modules, keyboard doesn't work. Except ^C to quit.
  * UDF filesystem support so that we know the location of the first video
    related file with 100% reliability (great change that should make DVDs
    with binaries and extra stuff work with vlc).
  * Correction of a bug in ifo reading that falsified the adress of
    video titles.
  * Changed the method for selecting title at start. It is _not_ reliable
    though, but it is better than the preceding one.
  * Tried to fix the BeOS interface and video output. Any BeOS developers
    listening ? I can't even test that code, it probably wants additional
    fixing.
  * Added a workaround in modules.c for broken libc's which happen to truncate
    filenames in dentry structures when using 64bits offsets. The kind of
    stuff you only see in RedHats <g>.
  * Made the SDL error messages a bit more useful.
  * The Gnome menu is now created when mouse is released, not when it
    is pressed. It may sound stupid, but it really makes a difference.

0.2.61
Fri, 16 Feb 2001 08:09:59 +0100

  * Fixed package building (both RPMs and .debs).
  * Fixed `make snapshot' rule.
  * Added some magic to filename detection. To read a DVD you now just
    need to run 'vlc dvd:/dev/hdc' for instance. Same for file:// URIs.
  * Fixed a segfault in the slider when no stream was playing.
  * Made the slider go from 0 to 100 (instead of 99 :)
  * The vlc now doesn't exit when finished playing. As a side effect of
    the playlist code being very recent, it continuously loops.
  * Fixed a segfault in the input thread creation, as well as a possible
    deadlock. This happened mostly when opening non-existing files.
  * Created input_SetStatus to do input_SetRate's job. input_SetRate will
    be used to set an arbitrary rate, for people who want to read DVDs at
    1/2.71828 times the actual speed.
  * Stubs for the ncurses control interface. No working code yet, but the
    holes just need to be filled.
  * Improved X11 support. Still not as functional as before.
  * The output window now states the method name, so that people know whether
    they are using X11 or SDL.
  * The Gnome interface is now drag'n'drop aware, you can drop a file
    on it just like Xine does (or so I guess).
  * New more recent css authentication code.
  * Beginning of udf support (not in Makefile)
  * Removed useless includes in intf_gnome.c
  * Made the vout_sdl.c functions static
  * Ported vout_x11.c to the modules API; code isn't very nice yet though
  * X11 output works again. It's just the output, but it works; I now need
    to clean the code and add event handling.
  * Should have fixed the dependency generater for some plugins.

0.2.60
Wed, 14 Feb 2001 08:33:46 +0100

  * Started porting the X11 vout (still disabled)
  * A few unnoticeable changes in the Gnome intf
  * Changes in the way stream size in DVD mode is calculated. It is no
    longer such an ugly kludge and is much more accurate.
  * Changes in DVDSeek so that the interface slider is in 0 when we are at
    the beginning of the strem.
  * Try to detect the beginning of the movie in the middle of the title. It
    works for most of the DVDs but will begin in the middle of the movie
    with some others.
  * Calculate only the first title key in css mode because it might take a
    long time with some title. The search stops now when we have a key once
    whereas it did stop only when we had it twice before. It should not
    cause problems.
  * Really fixed MC segfault bug.
  * Adaptation of DVD module to navigation slider. The seek has to be
    done on a multiple of 2048, and shopuld take care of the offset to the
    beginning of the stream. It works with most of my DVDs by fails to
    detect size of some streams.
  * Change of the order of call to ifo and css functions in input_dvd.c,
    because we can't read ifo files before authentification on some DVDs.
  * Changed location of some css tables.
  * We read ifo date and decrypt css keys for all titles now. It takes quite a
    long time to initialize with some DVDs (if you have 42 titles for
    instance). The key decryption might give a false value if the title is
    less than 10 Mb ; I'm working on that :)
  * Quick patch to avoid a segfault when arbitrarily seeking the stream.
  * Added --intf option to vlc
  * Started cleaning vout_sdl.c
  * The dummy plugin works again
  * Added a slider to the Gnome interface so that we can browse through streams
  * Removed enhancement because of an incompatibility with slow motion.
  * We can now seek at position 0 :p ;
  * Tried to enhance picture dating on timebase discontinuities.
  * Fixed pause bug.
  * Much cleaning in css code. It should work fine now.
  * Fixed my old stupid bug that disabled sound after having played the
    first playlist item.
  * Added `Prev' and `Next' buttons to the interface, with the beginning of
    a playlist window (still empty).
  * Added `Slow' and `Fast' buttons to the interface and popup menu.
  * Removed tests against i_rate and i_new_rate calculation from the
    plugins and hid this complexity into input_ext-intf.c
  * The pure Gnome part of the Gnome interface has been rewritten from
    scratch, and the .glade file included as well. You can edit it by
    installing glade-gnome and doing `glade plugins/gnome/intf_gnome.glade',
    or directly by hand if you grok XML.
  * Files can now be loaded into vlc using the `Open' buttons. But for the
    moment you still have to launch vlc with at least one file, because it
    quits when the end of the playlist is reached.
  * Idle screen was disabled because it eats a lot of CPU and is mostly
    useless for the moment. And it gets activated when pause lasts for too
    long.
  * Plugins have completely disappeared, we now only use the new module API.
  * All intf and vout modules are now independant. So far, only the Gnome
    intf module and the SDL vout module have been ported. configure.in has
    been modified to reflect the changes (x11 and dummy aren't compiled by
    default anymore, while SDL and Gnome are).
  * Right-clicking on the SDL video output window brings the Gnome menu.
  * Pause, Play, Exit, About work from the menu or from the interface window.
  * The old SDL keys still work.
  * Fixed a bug in #define that prevented from using ioctls
  * Some functions to prepare ifo commands utilisation to move in the
    structures of DVDs
  * Change in configure to avoid compiling css functions on BSD.
  * Added comments to src/interface/intf_plst.c and include/intf_plst.h
    so that people understand how the playlist works.
  * Updated the TODO list (34 items to do, 41 done !)
  * Portability : changed off64_t to off_t and activated appropriate
    GNU/Linux options ;
  * Changed fseek() to fseeko() for 64-bit offsets ;
  * Reset frame predictors on a stream discontinuity.
  * Implemented basic stream navigation function, and bound Jump forward
    and jump Backward in the SDL intf. Enjoy !
  * Pause function implemented ('p' key).
  * Fixed a compile probleme on machine without a dvd player :ppppp
  * Fixed two bugs in ifo and css that caused memory corruption and
    segfault when using sdl in dvd mode.
  * Moved the playlist handling from input/input.c to interface/interface.c
  * Fixed a few warnings at compile-time.
  * Fixed sound channel selection in playlist mode.
  * Added a color message in the plugin bank because on peut bien dconner
    cinq minutes, quand-mme.
  * We now spawn a new input thread for each file.
  * Added a missing pf_close() because it's always cool to close files
    after we read them.
  * Solved bug with cssdescrambling. The vlc might segfault with dvd
    plugins. I will fix that soon.
  * Minor modification in pluginification.
  * Playlist works again (still the old wrong way like Meuuh doesn't
    like, but this is going to change within a few hours)
  * Input_ps, input_ts and input_dvd are now plugins, located in
    plugins/mpeg/ and plugins/dvd/
  * Fast/slow keys are now A/Z instead of A/S since S was already
    linked to the scale/noscale toggle.
  * `--dvd' doesn't work anymore, for the moment try to use :
    vlc --input dvd /dev/dvd
  * Module bank is now less verbose ; use `--warn 1' to turn back
    verbosity on
  * New method using netlist to read packets on DVD device by sectors of
    2048 bytes.
  * Some modifications in netlist to make it work with DVD.
  * Fixed  bug in mpeg_system.c
  * We can now choose the speed of forward (between 32/1 and 1/8)
  * Functional fast forward and slow motion API ;
  * Dirty hack in the SDL intf to bind "a" (fAst forward), "s" (Slow motion)
    and "p" (Play).
  * Centralized clock management, preparing for stream navigation ;
  * Fixed a bug in the management of the first video PTS.
  * Fixed a bug in period calculation for progressive sequences.
  * Fixed a FIXME in SDL: p_vout->p_sys is no more used in intf_sdl.c
  * Used instead p_vout->i_changes like in x11
  * Disabled SDL parachute to let the vlc dump a core instead of staying stuck
  * Patched 2 debian bugs
    (see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=vlc)
  * Improved the snapshot generation
  * Mouse pointer hidden/shown with middle button in SDL output
  * Removed obsolete video_yuv_mmx.S
  * Updated the TODO list and wrote a small todo.pl parser to make it
    easier to see which items remain to be done
  * `make snapshot' now creates vlc-*.tar.gz and vlc-*-nocss.tar.gz

0.2.50
Wed, 31 Jan 2001 04:30:37 +0100

  * Version 0.2.50 for the Linux Expo
  * --overlay and --fulscreen options (only work with --vout sdl)
  * The vlc exits after the end of the stream, which prevents from having
    to kill it and relaunch it during a presentation.
  * Not a very nice hack, but will probably spare us a few user complaints: if
    no -a option is specified, the vlc will play the first audio type it finds,
    so there is no need to specify "-a ac3" for a DVD anymore.
  * CSS support kludged for current DVD input.
    It is very slow now but will be more adapted to the forthcoming DVD
    input.
    It should read the first title of many DVDs but has been tested with few.
  * Beginning of ifo commands to implement DVD navigation.
  * Fix for field pictures.
  * Hooks for fast forward and slow motion support.
  * Fixed backwards moves.
  * Tuned up optimizations.
  * Completely removed BIZARRE_OPTIMS.
  * Check for the needed headers for DVD ioctls
  * Some cleaning in the dvd authentification code
  * Various miscellaneous minor optimizations of the video parser.
  * Beginning of support for encrypted DVDs.
  * It only tests encryption and authenticates disc.
  * Really fixed GetChunk now.
  * 32-bit aligned bitstream (not that fast).
  * The motion compensation routines are now modules as well ; choose your
    implementation with `--motion motion', `--motion motionmmx' or
    `--motion motionmmxext'. Of course, the best implementation is chosen
    if you don't ask for any. There doesn't seem to be any performance hit
    due to the move to shared libs, which is a good thing. Please test
    actively if you have time, though.
  * Updated --help result, manpage, INSTALL document, and a few files.
  * Borrowed LiViD's MMX and MMX EXT IDCT. This might break things. Expect
    a performance increase.
  * Removed a few useless malloc() and unused variables in the audio SDL stuff
  * Prepared the work for built-in modules (not yet finished)
  * Small tweak in the copy handling, reduce CPU usage.
  * --aout sdl now works
  * Added SDL sound support. Sounds a bit laggy sometimes but my streams
    are ill.  please try.
  * Modified configure.in and all that stuff. Re-run configure
  * SDL audio, video and interface are all part of the same .so now.
  * Removed YUV old files :->
  * Reverted something that wasn't supposed to go into the cvs :p
  * Removed -fargument-noalias-global which causes problems with as (???).
  * Borrowed livid's latest libmmx and MMXEXT MC. Not in the Makefile => to
    test it, replace vdec_motion_inner_mmx.c by vdec_motion_inner_mmxext.c.
  * A few changes in the CPU extensions detection code, borrowed from the
    kernel and from mpeg2dec. I still don't know how to detect if code
    compiled with -mcpu=pentiumpro will run, since the cpuid arcanes are
    quite obtuse to me. Perhaps we should also have a way not to load modules
    if they have been compiled with a different CPU to avoid segfaults.
  * Add check for MMX EXT extensions, which doesn't work, which is a good
    thing since there is no MMX EXT IDCT yet :)
  * Change for the forthcoming fast forward and slow motion support.
  * Fixed the --aout, --idct and --yuv flags
  * Updated manpage and --(long)help output to reflect that change
  * Removed a few unneeded #includes here and there
  * Cosmetic changes in error messages in input.c
  * Now use of 64 bits offsets to parse the whole DVD. So we have all the
    available information
  * Fixed a bug in parsing of VTS attributes
  * Fixed a bug in input.c that made input plugin initialize even though
    no stream is reachable (thanks Sam)
  * Merged the YUV plugins in the same directory to avoid too much code
    duplication
  * YUV transformations now use the new module API ; now only the vout
    and interface still depend on the old plugin API
  * Changed TestMMX to TestCPU because we will be able to test for other
    specific extensions (3DNow, SSE) for the forthcoming IDCT we'll
    borrow to mpeg2dec (as usual :P)
  * Don't show "hiding module" messages anymore except in debug mode
  * Swapped C IDCT and Classic IDCT scores since the classic one seems
    to be faster ; anyway you should use the MMX one
  * Fixed a Makefile bug under BeOS
  * Tried to fix the cpuid code so that it compiles under BeOS (Polux, can
    you test it when you have time ?)
  * Fixed a bug in the frame rate handling ;
  * Fixed a bug in the DTS/PTS ordering. Our pts are _at last_ accurate.
  * Finally fixed repeat_first_field and co. (pas encore tout compris...)
  * Implemented video_parser bitstream callback for PTS/DTS.
  * Fixed close button support in SDL
  * Fixed --width and --height support in SDL
  * Fixed the bug-that-made-the-vlc-segfault-on-exit, which means that
    more than ever,  le client ne segfaulte pas .
  * There was still a problem upon quitting: sometimes the null packet
    wasn't big enough to reach a decoder breakpoint, so I now create 10
    of them (since I can't make it bigger) to be sure. Meuuh, what do
    you think ?
  * Fixed the Makefile to spare a few variables here and there.
  * Reduced module hide delay, removed loading of the audio output
    plugins since they are now modules.
  * Changed a few intf_Msg to intf_DbgMsg, and added "vout:", "intf:",
    and so on in a few other messages.
  * Removed unused includes in the idct modules.
  * Correction of bugs in ifo parsing. Now the structures should be well
    initialized. It remains some segfaults but it globally works.
  * DVD mode is enabled with option --dvd. For the moment, it only read
    the first vts and find the movie if it is at the beginning of the title
    set.
  * Beginning of dvd_input. Parsing of ifo file almost completed.
  * The IDCT functions are now located in modules : the classic IDCT,
    our optimized IDCT, and MMX IDCT.
  * Cosmetic changes for modules (pf_* instead of p_*)
  * Fixes to the BeOS and dummy modules
  * Changed default values :
    INPUT_PTS_DELAY down to 200 ms ;
    video heap down from 10 to 5 pictures ;
    decoder fifo size from 1023 to 511 PES ;
  * Fixed various bugs in 32 bit-versions of input_ext-dec.h ;
  * Fixed a bug in GetChunk() ;
  * Renamed GetByte, GetWord, ShowWord to _GetByte, _GetWord, _ShowWord ;
  * Moved decoder_fifo-specific code from programs.c to dec.c ;
  * Fixed bugs in program.c that prevented vlc to close all decoders ;
  * Gave sam a lesson for the use of the bitstream in spu_decoder.c :ppp ;
  * Made the video parser unlock the reference pictures before quitting
    (still one left, yaknow why ?)
  * Destroy fifo mutex and cond variables _after_ they are used for
    the last time. henri, that'll be one binouze.
  * Attempt to port the BeOS audio plugin to the new module API. Will
    probably need a few fixes to work or even compile.
  * Ported the alsa plugin to the news vlc module API
  * Fixed 32 bits bitstream bugs.
  * Moved the MPEG audio decoder to the new bitstream
  * Cleaning in the SPU decoder.
  * Moved swab32 from input_ext-dec.h to common.h. We probably won't need
    it anymore really soon, since ntohl() and htonl() seem to be properly
    optimized when gcc is passed the right optimization flags.
  * Fixed GetBits32 and RemoveBits32. I know the #ifdefs are useless since
    we only support u32 words, but it's a safe reminder. Comments appreciated
    on this fix since I may have b0rked something -- it runs well here though.
  * Changed code for handling b_die in bitstream ;
  * Moved input_ext-dec.h to input.h ;
  * New input_NullPacket function ;
  * Fixed init bugs in input and vpar ;
  * Placed a callback to the decoder in the bitstream structure ;
  * Fixed a purify bug in input_ps.c ;
  * Added -mcpu=pentiumpro in the Makefile.
  * Complete commenting of modules_core.h and small modifications
  * Separated MODULE_CONFIG_START and ADD_WINDOW (Henri, beware)
  * Fixed a very, very old bug that caused namespace collision between
    plugins (Henri, beware: call your aout_getplugin function like this,
    not alsa_aout_getplugin)
  * Removed the Debian specific clean rules from the Makefile, since they
    are already handled by the debian/rules script.
  * Tidied a few compilation rules (-lfoo should always be at the end)
  * Added 8bits palette SDL support.
  * Fixed a warning under FreeBSD (dlerror() is a const char*, not a char*).
  * Made configure script look for the bswap assembly instruction (using
    AC_TRY_COMPILE makes sure the compiler will really accept it).
  * Fixed colors' bug (TODO: write a function in vout that recalculate colors
    from RGB masks);
  * Cleaning of the fullscreen switch, still sucks but the surface is not
    reallocated and that's good (thanks to the magic function
    SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen provided by sdl library :).
  * Added a missing mutex_unlock in video_output.c
  * Moved a mutex_destroy after the thread cancellation to prevent
    possible problems
  * Added a missing #ifdef in intf_msg.c which prevented compilation
    with --enable-debug
  * Fixed a bug in the input that prevented to quit properly in certain
    cases (some ES were not deleted because their index was skipped when
    the former one was deleted, well Meuuh should know what I mean)
  * Cleaning of SDL Lock/Unlock Surface.
  * All plugins now compile with -fPIC.
  * Made the audio_output API a bit simpler.
  * Got rid of modules_config.h.
  * Fixed `make install' rule.
  * Fixed warnings in the MMX YUV compilation.
  * Probably fixed a bug in the input : pp_foo structures were free()d at
    the end, but this was useless since the last call to realloc() is
    equivalent to free(), and two consecutive calls to free() aren't a
    goo idea.
  * We check that the version number match and that we don't already have
    a module by that name when loading a new module.
  * All public module_* functions now properly lock the module bank.
  * The audio_output now uses the new module API ; EsounD and DSP modules
    have been ported, which should be enough for Henri to port the ALSA one.
  * Added vlc_mutex_destroy and vlc_cond_destroy function, for pthreads.
    Used them before quitting, every lock and cond is destroyed
  * Checked the return value of malloc and realloc in input_programs
  * Fixed compilation pb under solaris 2.6
  * Should compile & run on Solaris with ./configure --disable-dsp
    (tested on puma)
  * Removed most SYS_SOLARIS #ifdef's in favour of more generic tests
  * Updated example ./configure line in INSTALL file
  * Now we only load modules that end with ".so"
  * null module is compiled by default
  * Fixed initialization of payload_start and payload_end
  * --enable-sdl and some others are now --with-sdl[=name] to supply an
    optional library name ;
  * Deleted all unnecessary #include <sys/uio.h> ;
  * /usr/include is now searched when looking for libraries and headers.
  * src/misc/modules.c is in a workable state now.
  * Splitted modules.h into modules.h and modules_core.h to enable
    clean compilation of the Null Module.
  * Added the Null Module, the module that does nothing but that is going
    to be of great help for debugging my module code.
  * Plugins are now called modules, because we will be able to compile
    them either as a dynamic plugin, or within the program. And, more
    important, I can commit this without having to break the vlc :)
  * Fixed pitch bug;
  * video_output.c : compute picture size even if b_need_render == 0;
  * Fixed a deadlock (the vout unlocked a mutex locked by another thread,
    grrrr, I'll kill someone) ;
  * Put config.h in front of others in audio_decoder.c.
  * Better display of the fps.
  * Removed i_iovec_start and i_iovec_end. Used i_data instead
  * Fixed THX Cimmarron bug (it was _not_ a synchro bug).
  * Fixed a bug in the DTS/PTS parsing ;
  * Fixed a bug in vpar_headers.c synchro handling introduced before ;
  * Enhanced synchro's handling of dates and frame structure changes.
  * Fixed a bug in the PSM decoder.
  * We now read the DTS (but we don't use it for the moment).
    NB : b_has_pts has disappeared for brevity reasons, use i_pts != 0 instead.
  * New synchro statistics and warnings.
  * Avoid calling SafeRead() with a null packet size.
  * Use of ptrdiff_t whenever necessary (IA-64 port) ;
  * Changed behaviour of preparsing code, faster startup ;
  * Fixed DecodePSM(), cannot test ;
  * Cleaned up ParsePES(), fixed a bug which could reject very small but
    valid PES packets ;
  * Fixed cosmetic bugs in vpar_synchro frame_rate display.
  * Changed subtitles palette.
  * SPU decoder now uses Meuuh's GetChunk() code.
  * Lots of cleaning in the SPU decoder.
  * Message queue is flushed before we spawn input.
  * Fixed so that it compiles with VDEC_SMP (no good sync yet though).
  * Using i_id instead of i_stream_id whenever possible ;
  * Fixed a bug in -c and -s options.
  * Fixed a compile pbm in debug mode (f34r d4 1-line fix)
  * Fixed AC3 and SPU PES reading (ph34r da one-byte patch)
  * Some 79 char wrap.
  * No need to add "\n" at the end of intf_*Msg() messages anymore.
  * Moved input_DecodePES() to input_dec.c ;
  * Fixed an segfault in input_programs.c ;
  * Added -fomit-frame-pointer optimization.
  * Fixed a *major* memory leak in the pre-parsing code. Hopefully it should
    be the last one.
  * New decoder spawning API input_dec.c ;
  * Moved p_input->pp_es -> p_input->stream.pp_es and clean up of
    input_programs.c & co ;
  * Fixed memory leaks.
  * Moved video_decoder's headers from include/ to src/video_decoder.
  * Temporarily removed b&w kludge.
  * Splitted up p_method_data/p_plugin_data ;
  * Cleaned up input_ts.c, added it into the Makefile.
  * Fixed various memory leaks.
  * Removed all arbitrary limits on the number of elementary streams.
  * Removed b_die and b_error from all decoders (obsoleted by decoder_fifo_t).
    All decoders should now exit cleanly (if it's not the case, it should be
    referenced as a bug).
  * Fixed a bug which prevented the input to exit normally (non-selected
    ES in the pp_selected_es array).
  * Added netlist support.
  * Added U8_Mono audio output
  * Fixed "-a [ mpeg | ac3 | lpcm | off ]" option
  * Only pre-parse the first 32 MB of data.
  * Added -a, -c and -s options. (-a doesn't work but I will let the people
    who thought it would be cleaner to put config in environment variables
    correct what's wrong in my code).
  * Now we only try to open plugins which are existing files
  * Big cleanup of the PS input plugin ;
  * Fixed a bug in AC3 initialization ;
  * PS streams are now pre-parsed (this can take a while) if possible ;
  * Move #define from audio_output.h to config.h
  * Change vlan_server_ip to vishnou's ip (but vlans not working yet)
  * GetChunk() : reads n bytes from the elementary stream and places them
    in a big buffer (a gift for Sam).
  * Quantic start in fullscreen fixed.
  * Input-II now correctly handles private stream 1 (AC3, DVDSPU).
  * Split the audio decoder into adec_generic, adec_layer1 and adec_layer2
    (no new code added)
  * Added SDLYUV support,
  * Fixed the ratio/position problem in YUV,
  * We now display CPU usage statistics for each thread.
  * Additional fix for Layer 1 mono
  * Indentation fixes
  * Fixed audio syncword detection for mpeg 1 streams (hopefully)
  * Fixed Layer 2 Mono decoding.
  * Hardware YUV overlay (SDL) with real colors ;p It may suck for non
    4:2:0 streams.
  * Removed vout code found in intf file to support fullscreen switching.
    Now only vout_SDL updates SDL data and intf only switch flags such as
    b_reopen_display and b_fullscreen in p_vout->p_sys.
  * Fixed a var name typo in input_programs.c which prevents vlc from
    compiling with --enable-debug option. (i_es_pid -> i_es_id :)
  * Autodetection of Overlay support
  * Fixed support for broken MPEG-1 files.
  * Cleaned up program and ES management by using input_programs.c whenever
    necessary.
  * Cleaned up decoder spawning.
  * Enhanced handling of stream discontinuities.
  * Fixed two typos in the Makefile (sam you owe me at least one beer)
  * Moved b_discontinuity to pgrm_descriptor_t, cleaned up CRDecode
    (needs some more cleaning for discontinuities)
  * Added pf_new_pes in plugins
  * Fix in the SCR parser for high values.
  * Fixed a bug with DVD's SCR (too close from the PTS).
  * Generation d'un makefile presque correct pour les vieilles versions de make
    Nettoyage: gestion des dependances pour les plugins, suppressions de pas
    mal de redondances, options de compilations coherentes, etc...
  * Code to manage es_descriptors and program_descriptors, from benny's
    input_psi.c
  * VLAN support modified.
  * We now correctly parse MPEG-1 SCR and there is no need to kludge to read
    the stream at the right pace.
  * Fixed a bug in the synchro with non-P5/B1 streams.
  * Support for MPEG-1 .mpg files.
  * Fixed a bug in the synchro with non-P5/B1 streams.
  * The input-II.

0.2.0
Wed, 31 Jan 2001 04:30:37 +0100

  * Version 0.2.0 pour la Linux Expo
  * Backport of the sdl plugin (minor correction in video_output as I made
    in unstable)
  * Ajout des options --fullscreen et --overlay
