Description: multimedia player for all audio and video formats
 VLC is the VideoLAN project's media player. It plays MPEG, MPEG2, MPEG4,
 DivX, MOV, WMV, QuickTime, mp3, Ogg/Vorbis files, DVDs, VCDs, and multimedia
 streams from various network sources.

 VLC can also be used as a streaming server that duplicates the stream it
 reads and multicasts them through the network to other clients, or serves
 them through HTTP.

 VLC has support for on-the-fly transcoding of audio and video formats, either
 for broadcasting purposes or for movie format transformations. Support for
 most output methods is provided by this package, but features can be added
 by installing additional audio plugins (vlc-plugin-esd, vlc-plugin-alsa,
 vlc-plugin-arts) or video plugins (vlc-plugin-sdl, vlc-plugin-ggi,
 vlc-plugin-glide, vlc-plugin-svgalib). There is also a web browser plugin
 in the mozilla-plugin-vlc package.
