Basically our asx parser is broken. It doesn't handle relative links. It should also URL encode the hrefs (spaces in the url need to be converted to %20 etc). protocol rollover, authors, title's etc etc aren't handled. See <a href="http://www.meetnewplayers.com/bend/Windows%20Media%20-%20Fun%20with%20asx%20files2.htm">this</a> for asx examples.

The LPCM decoder outputs really small samples which aren't accepted properly by the macosx coreaudio resampler, causing VLC to not output any sound with many DVD's. A test sample that shows this effect on the mac is the Madonna clip.<br />
This is now fixed, but there is a problem with buffers in the resampler that now sometimes overflows (or rather get changed after they are released). A good method for reproduction seems to be running Finding Nemo for a minute or 8.

 To have this work correctly, the best solution is to remove knowledge of

Description: Vout redesign
- vout needs distinct splitting into vout_core, vout_window, pic_filter, vout_filter<br />
- needs 'assistance' vout windows (clone filters, goom) etc.<br />
- 4:3, 16:9, freeform Aspect Ratio<br />
- cropping and padding (do at OS level, but provide a core call to set it up and configure).<br />
- OSD at window resolution instead of video res (secondary vout channel)<br />
- a OSD needs to be bound to a vout stream (no subs on goom vout)<br />
- Use OS native calls where appropriate, with 'C' fallbacks. (OpenGL, Quartz, DirectX already has many of the funtionalities we seek and sometimes they are a lot faster too).<br />
- Allow a vout to reuse a window by resizing it (instead of closing and opening).
- better hotkeys integration

Description: skins2
Port VLC skins to Objective C++ and OSX. Also requires the intf to be a dialog provider. There is already some code in the VLC sourcetree.<br />

 - In a first step, the need for a dialog provider can be easily omitted.<br />
 - In theory, only a small amount of classes (6 or so) must be written for OS X, implementing predefined interfaces.<br />
 - The code of <a href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK</a> could be really helpful to identify the correct functions and see how to use them.

 - Inform the user, without disturbing him. (Buffering stream). This might require a displaytime or something. Because how do we know how long this information should be displayed? Also think of buffering 0-100%<br /> 
 - present a user/passwd dialog when we get an authentication failure on a stream.<br />

 - via variables and callbacks. How to give answers back ?<br />
