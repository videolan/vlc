 and have it display the stream in the same window.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x5d
Difficulty: Guru
Urgency: Normal
Description: Win32 port
 Win32 is probably the most common desktop platform, we should support it
 as well. Besides, most students at Centrale use Windows and VideoLAN was
 originally designed for them.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x5c
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Wishlist
Description: Infrared support
 Write a plugin which listens to the infrared port and sends appropriate
 commands to the application. This can either be an interface plugin, or,
 preferably, a new kind of interface-agnostic "command" plugin.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x5b
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Critical
Description: Fix the FreeBSD port
 The FreeBSD port of vlc doesn't run, probably because of a pthread
 issue. This should be investigated.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x5a
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Wishlist
Description: Share stream information between vlc and vls
 vls should send misc TS packets to let us know what the stream PID
 contain, such as the language, or the subtitle palette.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x59
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Important
Description: Cope with vls/vlc clock jitter
 The internal clocks of the server and the client are not assured to be
 in perfect synchronization, which may be annoying when playing a movie.

Task: 0x55
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Critical
Description: Video output IV
 The new video output should support subtitles both in software and hardware
 YUV (see item 0x4d). One should also care about XVideo buffers, there is a
 way to directly decode into them, which would improve performances.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x54
Difficulty: Hard

 (optional) and parse .ifo files.
Status: Done 8 Feb 2001 (stef)

Task: 0x44
Difficulty: Guru
Urgency: Important
Description: Write input_ext-intf.c
 This file will provide functions which allow the interface to change
 the pace of reading and change the position in the file.
Status: Done 8 Feb 2001 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x43

 We need a centralized manner of creating new programs, es, and
 spawning new decoders.
Status: Done 20 Dec 2000 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x40
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Important
Description: Fix the PS plugin
 The PS plugin should be able to recover from packet loss, to
 read MPEG-1 .mpg files, and to pre-parse the stream (if possible)
 to build the ES table. Check what's wrong and fix it. Now.
Status: Done 20 Dec 2000 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x3f
Difficulty: Easy
Urgency: Critical
Description: Enhance intf_*Msg
 The intf_*Msg functions could be more clever : add "mymodule
 warning/error:" and \n automatically. The new input already
 uses such a behaviour, so we must hurry. It might be necessary
 to modify all messages in all modules...
Status: Done 20 Dec 2000 (sam)

Task: 0x3e
Difficulty: Guru
Urgency: Critical
Description: Fix backwards moves
 Sometimes the frames seem to go backwards for a short period of
 time. This is due to the output methods and is known to happen
 with the x11 and SDL plugins.
Status: Done 27 Nov 2000 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x3d
Difficulty: Easy
Urgency: Normal
Description: Have more statistics messages displayed
 The vlc has structures to keep track of the interesting
 events, but there is no way to print these structures. In stats
 mode, we should print these structures regularly, or at quit
 time (whichever is the more convenient).
Status: Done 27 Nov 2000 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x3c
Difficulty: Easy
Urgency: Important
Description: Separate optimizations from debug mode
 We sometimes want to have the debug mode (which writes an
 interesting log of debug messages) along with the compiler
 optimizations (which allow decoding of more than 2 fps).
Status: Done 18 Nov 2000 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x3b
Difficulty: Easy
Urgency: Important
Description: Write intf_WarnMsg and intf_StatMsg
 We have intf_ErrMsg to display fatal errors, but warnings are
 drowned in an ocean of unreadable intf_DbgMsg. Same for
 statistics messages.
Status: Done 23 Nov 2000 (Stef)

Task: 0x3a
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Important
Description: Support SDL Overlay
 The SDL livrary has routines to use the video board to do the YUV
 conversion, scaling and displaying. Using them will require a
 partial rewrite of the video_output way of handling rendering
 and displaying.
Status: Done 18 Dec 2000 (bozo and oct)

Task: 0x39
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Wishlist
Description: Rewrite the font display routines
 The current font display routines aren't powerful enough. There
 should be a way to display a big String at once, without needing
 to compute the size of the string and its coordinates beforehand.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x38
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Important
Description: Make aout eat less CPU
 When the vlc is launched without a stream, the audio_output thread
 eats all memory, probably because there is no msleep() when no data
 is available in the audio_output queue.
Status: Done (henri)

Task: 0x37

Status: Done 27 Aug 2000 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x36
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Normal
Description: Enhance the interface
 . Finish the new keyboard input interface to support 
   interfaces that allow modifiers. This will allow the SDL to run 
   properly.
 . Here are some details:
   Allow any interface to have its own set of keys:
    - allow the 'discovery' of the main interface of the binding 
      created by each interface:
       what key ("control-C", what action (INTF...))
    - extend the interface by a specific struct (meta+modifier+ascii)
    - implement an interface specific getKey function.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x35
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Important
Description: Fix plugins namespace problem
 When compiling a plugin, all symbols seem to be exported, while we
 actually just need GetConfig and a few other things: the other
 functions are accessed through function pointers.
Status: Done 10 Jan 2001 (sam)

Task: 0x34
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Important
Description: Fix plugin autoloading
 At the moment, plugins to be detected are hardcoded in the code. We
 need a better method to get all available plugins, by listing all the
 files in selected directories.
Status: Done 7 Jan 2001 (sam)

Task: 0x33
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Important
Description: Real plugin API
 We need some functions to register plugins, automatically detect which
 ones are the most appropriate, as well as ways to express that plugin
 A won't work unless plugin B is activated as well.
Status: Done 7 Jan 2001 (sam)

Task: 0x32
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Important
Description: Enable compiled-in plugins
 Some plugins may have their place inside the main program, such as the
 dummy plugin, or the beos plugin under BeOS. We should allow to link
 them with the main app.
Status: Done 15 Apr 2001 (sam)

Task: 0x31
Difficulty: Easy
Urgency: Normal
Description: Optimize SPU rendering
 There is an if() in the SPU display routine to double lines when needed,
 whiwh is rather inefficient. It should be removed and put outside
 the main loop.
Status: Done 26 Aug 2000 (henri)

Task: 0x30
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Important
Description: SPU error recovery
 The SPU decoder does not behave very well when a packet is missed or when
 it gets the stream at the middle of an SPU packet. Make it more error-
 friendly.

Task: 0x2b
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Wishlist
Description: Shoot the TODO list on the web site
 The TODO list on the web site hasn't been updated for months. We may
 wonder then why the hell to we put a TODO list on the web site ? Maybe
 we'd better shoot it in the head, that would make its suffering end.

Description: Support for RTP
 RTP is a transport protocol for realtime applications. MPEG1 and MPEG2
 versions of RTP are described in RFCs 2038 and 2250. RFCs 1889 (RTP)
 and 2508 (compressed RTP) can be interesting as well.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x28
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Wishlist
Description: Draw a font / support color fonts
 The vlc currently uses an ugly font to display its data on the output
 window, and we have a slow hack to make it outlined. Writing our own
 font, or adding support for color fonts, would make us gain some time.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x27
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Important
Description: Layer 2 mono support
 The vlc doesn't play layer 2 mono yet. We need it since a few of our
 streams are in this audio format.
Status: Done 18 Dec 2000 (sam)

Task: 0x26
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Wishlist
Description: MP3 support
 The vlc cannot play MPEG1/2 layer 3 yet. It might be nice to fix that.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x25
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Normal
Description: Support for unencapsulated streams
 Some streams are not encapsulated in PES/PS or TS packets, which the
 vlc currently requires to properly decode a stream. Adding support for
 this would require to rewrite the input code, and probably make it a
 plugin.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x24
Difficulty: Guru
Urgency: Wishlist
Description: Ogg/Vorbis audio decoder support
 The Ogg/Vorbis audio format is a free alternative to the patent-encumbered
 MP3 format. The system packets are quite different than the MPEG ones, so
 adding support for it would require a lot of code rewrite.
Status: Todo

Task: 0x23

Description: Xv video output support
 XFree 4.0 provides the Xv interface which can do hardware YUV on supported
 hardware. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much documentation
 available.

Description: SDL video output support
 The Simple DirectMedia Layer library is a generic API that provides
 YUV acceleration on some platforms. More information can be found
 on http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/
Status: Done 21 Aug 2000 (octplane)

Task: 0x21
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Normal
Description: Implement pause
 There is no real `pause' command yet. Pausing just stops
 displaying and sound playback, but the streams continues to
 be decoded. One will have to do a file implementation as
 well as a network implementation.
Status: Done 8 Feb 2001 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x20
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Important
Description: Rewrite input for Program Stream files
 Currently when we read a PS file, it is first translated to TS
 because we first had only PS support. Now time has come to get
 rid of this ugly kludge and integrate a proper PS input.
Status: Done 5 Dec 2000 (Meuuh) because of Input II

Task: 0x1f
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Normal
Description: DeCSS and DVD ioctls
 The vlc needs the DVD ioctls support as well as the integration
 of DeCSS to play DVDs properly. The person doing this should
 probably not live in a country where DeCSS has been ruled illegal.

Task: 0x1c
Difficulty: Guru
Urgency: Important
Description: Fix field pictures support
 Some MPEG2 streams are interleaved, and the vlc does not support
 this very well. Adding support for them requires an excellent
 knowledge of the MPEG2 papers.
Status: Done 23 Aug 2000 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x1b

Description: Modularize decoder
 Make the decoder a plugin, so that two versions can coexist
 without recompilation (MMX and non-MMX).
Status: Done 16 Jan 2001 (sam)

Task: 0x1a
Difficulty: Easy
Urgency: Normal
Description: Make interface more responsive
 When in "waiting for stream" mode, the interface is refreshed
 every 5 seconds. This is too long, and can be confusing for
 the user. Make it refresh at least after a keyboard/mouse event.
Status: Done 28 Aug 2000 (oct)

Task: 0x19
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Normal
Description: Support MP1 and MP3
 The vlc does not support all MPEG1 audio formats yet, nor
 does it support MPEG1/2 layer 3.
Status: Done 18 Dec 2000 (sam) but see 0x25

Task: 0x18
Difficulty: Guru
Urgency: Wishlist
Description: Split interface/video_output
 The interface and the vout modules are too dependant, which
 makes it impossible to run the Glide output with the Gnome
 interface for instance. This will require a major rewrite of
 the interface, and a solid knowledge of how the vlc internals
 work.
Status: Done 11 Feb 2001 (sam)

Task: 0x17

Task: 0x15
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Critical
Description: Fix input_file exit
 input_file does not exit cleanly when the file is finished,

Task: 0x0f
Difficulty: Easy
Urgency: Normal
Description: Better black&white support
 When in B&W mode, the chroma part of pictures is decoded,
 but it would be more efficient not to decode at all when
 the video decoder knows it does not need to.
Status: Done 25 Oct 2000 (reno)

Task: 0x0e

Description: Framebuffer exit bug
 When the vlc abnormally exits in framebuffer mode, it leaves
 the console in an unusable state. This does not happen on
 the Matrox framebuffer, but it does on the VESA one.

Task: 0x0c
Difficulty: Hard
Urgency: Critical
Description: Fix synchro
 The synchronization algorithm sucks a bit. While it is
 quite efficient on frameskipping on slow machines, it
 is not smart enough on fast machines and does not detect
 when it has enough time for a frame. Perhaps a better
 handling of the dates might help.
Status: Done 13 Nov 2000 (Meuuh)

Task: 0x0b
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Important
Description: Allow to force synchro
 Add a --force-synchro option to bypass the auto-adaptative
 algorithm present in the vlc. Options should allow displaying
 only I frames, only I and P, or all frames, or some more
 fancy stuff such as half the Bs.
Status: Done 8 Aug 2000 (sam)

Task: 0x0a
Difficulty: Medium
Urgency: Important
Description: Do separate packages
 The plugins can be compiled with specific libraries, such
 as Gnome, GGI, Esound. Putting all of them in the same
 package would require a lot of useless dependencies, thus
 one should do separate packages: a core "vlc" package, and
 "vlc-fb", "vlc-ggi", "vlc-esd" packages depending on the
 core package.
Status: Done 15 Aug 2000 (sam)

Task: 0x09
Difficulty: Easy
Urgency: Normal
Description: Get rid of dumb vlc aliases
 When compiling the vlc, some symlinks to the main app
 are created, such as gvlc, ggivlc, etc. Actually this
 might confuse the user, so they should be removed,
 except perhaps gvlc and fbvlc which follow a usual
 naming scheme.
