---------------------------------

Important notes:
 * The licenses of libVLC and libVLCcore have changed from GPLv2+ to LGPLv2.1+
 * Start/end titles/chapters are now specified with # rather than @ to fix
   conflicts with some URLs and file names. For instance, this plays a DVD
   from the 2nd chapter of the 1st title up to the 4th chapter of the 3rd
   title:  vlc dvd://#1:2-3:4
 * The 40+ --*-caching options were simplified and dumbed down to 4 options:
   - --file-caching specifies caching for local files,
   - --network-caching specifies caching for network resources,
   - --live-caching specifies caching for capture devices and
   - --disc-caching specifies caching for local optical media.
   All values are expressed in milliseconds as in previous versions.
 * HTTP server IP address, port, and TLS configuration is now centralized:
   - The --http-host option sets the address, e.g. "--http-host=[2001:db8::1]".
     By default, both :: and 0.0.0.0 are used.
   - The --http-port and --https-port options set the port numbers.
     By default, 8080 is used for HTTP, and 8443 for HTTPS.
   - The TLS credentials are configured with --http-cert (public certificate),
     --http-key (private key), --http-ca (optional CA) and
     --http-crl (optional CRL).
 * RTSP server IP address and port are updated similarly.
   Use --rtsp-host and --rtsp-port respectively.
 * The --miface-addr option does not exist anymore. To select the multicast
   output interface, use --miface instead, e.g. --miface=eth0.
 * The Windows version will only work with Windows XP SP2 or later.
   Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP < SP2, Windows 2003 SP0 are now unsupported.
 * The Mac OS version will require Quartz Extreme compatible machines.

Important changes for packagers:
 * The default builds now assume that the operating system uses UTF-8 for
   its file systems and files content (except the Windows port). If this is
   not acceptable, pass --enable-non-utf8 to the configure script.
   Non-UTF-8 file systems support will be removed in future versions.
 * The VLC plugins path can be overridden with the VLC_PLUGIN_PATH environment
   variable. The --plugin-path command line option was removed.

   generated at install time except if you use staged installation. In the
   later case, you can generate the module cache in your post-inst script
   by invoking 'vlc-cache-gen'. If the module cache is not present and vlc
   can't write in ${libdir}/vlc/, it will result it vlc taking a long time to
   launch each time.

   - xproto,
   - xcb, xcb-shm, xcb-xv, xcb-randr (from libxcb),
   - xcb-keysyms (from xcb-utils),
   - x11-xcb (from libx11) - only for GLX support.

   - On Mac OS X, you can find it in VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/.hosts
     and respectively in VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/old/.hosts
 * This version of VLC contains a new interface for Windows and Linux.
   This interface has a fullscreen controller and simplified preferences.
   This interface lacks the "Streaming Wizard" that used to be present in VLC
   0.8.6, but provides basic profiles.
 * The behavior of --sout-keep was changed. It's now activated by default.
 * The marq, mosaic and logo commands in the rc interface changed. They
   now require a target name as their first argument. Example:
   vlc --sub-filter "marq@test{marquee=Hello}" -I rc <somevideo>
   You can then use commands like: @test marq-marquee Goodbye
   If you didn't name the object using @test, its name will default to the
   plugin name (hence 'marq') in this example.
   These new commands are also available in the telnet interface.
 * The "rtp" access output module has been removed.
   Please use the RTP stream output instead, e.g.:
     Old: '#std{access=rtp,mux=ts,dst=239.255.1.2:5004,sap}'
     New: '#rtp{mux=ts,dst=239.255.1.2,port=5004,sap}'
 * You now need to append --m3u-extvlcopt to your command line to enable
   EXTVLCOPT options parsing in m3u playlists. Note that only a limited set
   of options is available to m3u playlists (CVE-2007-6683).
 * The old access:url syntax is no longer supported to resolve ambiguities
   with some file names. Use access://url instead.
    E.g.:  vlc:quit -> vlc://quit ;
           udp:@239.255.12.12 -> udp://@239.255.12.12
 * The ffmpeg module has been removed and replaced by the new avcodec,
   avformat, swscale (or imgresample if you use a swscale-less ffmpeg build)
   and postproc modules.
 * The web plugins ActiveX (IE)/Firefox/Mozilla/Safari now recognize the
   following states: IDLE/CLOSE=0, OPENING=1, BUFFERING=2, PLAYING=3, PAUSED=4,
   STOPPING=5, FORWARD=6, BACKWARD=7, ENDED=8, ERROR=9. With FORWARD and
   BACKWARD being reserved for future implementations and are thus not
   functional atm.
 * Croping and padding in transcode are now done using the croppadd video
   filter. For example:
   transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vfilter=croppadd{cropttop=20,cropbottom=30,paddleft=100}}
 * Canvas setting in transcode is now done using the canvas video filter.
   For example:
   transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vfilter=canvas{width=640,height=480}}
 * Glide video output module has been removed.
